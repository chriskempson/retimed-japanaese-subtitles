1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,650
Go! Go! Go!

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,690
Until junior high,
I was in soccer club.

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:13,170
But during high school,
I decided to join the boat club.

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,690
Go!

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,300
Go! Go!

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:26,200
Go! Go!

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,190
The last row!

8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,720
The last defining moment.

9
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,290
The reason why I couldn't cry..

10
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,690
What was it?

11
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,360
Although this might sound like
a lie because I say it myself..

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,190
I do have lots of friends.

13
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,200
But no one knows..

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,200
..about how uncool I am.

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,740
Before I entered high school, my homeroom teacher at junior high suggested me to get into a private school.

16
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,190
My parents also said that
I could get into a private school.

17
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,190
But I decided to enter a public school instead.

18
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,180
This month's income.
- Thank you.

19
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,700
My parents thought that I did that
because I was worried about the tuition fee.

20
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,200
They're wrong.

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,540
Good morning!

22
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,190
You surprised me..
- Good morning!

23
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,190
I want to get in the same school as Mihane.

24
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,260
She is also the reason
why I joined the boat club.

25
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,200
But because she hurted her waist,
she quitted that boat club last year.

26
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,190
The reason why I couldn't cry
is probably because of her too.

27
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,190
I wonder since when
I started to like Mihane.

28
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,710
Goro, hold up her head.

29
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,210
Roger!

30
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,200
I even felt envy towards a scissor.

31
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,690
I want to be a scissor.

32
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,690
Scissor, he said?!

33
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,690
I was so envy with a scissor
that could cut Mihane's hair.

34
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,230
If I think about it now,
I sounded like a pervert!

35
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,760
Bye~ Bye~ Bee~

36
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,200
Although I already decided to confess
my feeling to her in the summer festival..

37
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,190
At the end, I failed.

38
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:10,560
You like Mihane, right?

39
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,690
Eh?!

40
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,210
Shohei even realized that I like Mihane.

41
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:18,700
I wonder if it's alright for two
people, to love the same person.

42
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,270
What's with that question?

43
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,700
As if he just declared a war.

44
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,710
Hey, are you kidding me?!

45
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:32,680
I would end up hating him
if he steals Mihane from me.

46
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,900
Oh, no!

47
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,900
It starts drowning..

48
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,270
What are you doing?

49
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,190
She looks cuter than usual.

50
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,730
Shohei is so stupid!

51
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,780
How dare he kissed me suddenly like that?!

52
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,700
Anyway, that is not the problem!

53
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,700
I really want to scold him..

54
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,700
But, I couldn't say it in front of
Goro-chan who didn't see it.

55
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,710
I was thinking to leap through time,
but I was too hesitated to do it.

56
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:18,190
However, it's my first kiss.

57
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,230
I could not pretend as if it never happened.

58
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:25,230
Because it can't be wiped out from my memory.

59
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,190
How could you easily sleep, huh?

60
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,690
He pisses me off!

61
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:37,690
Mihane didn't leap through time.

62
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,700
Then, she doesn't hate it?

63
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,250
Somehow, I like her more than before.

64
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,690
Okay..

65
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,200
Excuse me, I'm going in.

66
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,170
Hey, we're in the middle of a lesson!

67
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,170
Transfer student?
No one told me about this.

68
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,690
Let's continue!

69
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:11,690
What are you doing?

70
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:15,680
Senpai, you're the one who told me
to enjoy living in this era, didn't you?

71
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,680
Fukamachi.. Aihara..

72
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,700
If you have a question, raise your hand!

73
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,200
Okay~

74
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,760
Eh, I don't have any question though..

75
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:38,400
"Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo"
(The Girl who Leapt Through Time)

76
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,640
Episode 3

77
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,680
Eh? I thought Goro-chan
is the one who cuts my hair.

78
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,730
Who is Goro?

79
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,900
Don't say that..

80
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,700
He is our childhood friend, Asakura Goro.

81
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,700
The son of "Asakura" Barbershop's owner.

82
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,690
Don't play dumb!

83
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,690
You really don't know him?

84
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,290
Where did Shohei go?

85
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:23,190
Onee-chan..
- Eh? What? What is it?

86
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,200
Onee-chan!
- Nooo~

87
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,200
Onee-chan!

88
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,700
Don't sleep there, it's dinner time!

89
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,690
Tonight, we have grilled meat!

90
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,710
Mihane, it's steak!

91
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,710
Wow, thank you!

92
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,210
Looks delicious..
- Bon appetit!

93
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:54,210
There are only three ingredients left!

94
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:58,210
We will soon be able to go
back to the 22nd century, right?

95
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,710
Yes, we will.

96
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,230
Anyway, about the school..

97
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:08,190
What's so fun about it?
The lesson was a waste of time!

98
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:11,690
It's already written on the textbook, but
the teacher re-wrote it on the blackboard.

99
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,680
And then, he told us to write it on our notebook?!

100
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,200
I don't get it!

101
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,790
Because twelfth graders will have to face a final
exam soon, you guys do not have to do this.

102
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,690
But, what should we do?

103
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,680
For the school festival.

104
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,680
In your last school festival here,
is there something you want to do?

105
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,180
Well, all tenth and eleventh graders have
already done their best to prepare it.

106
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,700
But I think, participating in
such event is not bad for you.

107
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,710
It will be your memories.

108
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,760
How about a choir?

109
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,680
How about doing it to refresh your mind
after studying for final exams, Hase Tamotsu?

110
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,200
I have a cram school after this.

111
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,700
Tabuchi Mana, since you're from the dance club,
how about performing a "Para Para" dance?

112
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,690
We are busy excercising for
the national competition.

113
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,670
Anyway, what is a "Para Para" dance?

114
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,460
You don't know a "Para Para" dance?

115
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,000
Like this.

116
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,800
You don't know this dance?
- So lame..

117
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,300
So, our class won't do anything for the festival?

118
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,180
Our class' performance has started!

119
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,200
♪ I came to a morning audition ♪

120
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,210
♪ My hairstyle looks so OK ♪

121
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:54,760
What kind of dance is it?
Cool, isn't it? Amazing, right?!

122
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,700
All twelfth graders take it easy, but
the eleventh graders look so passionate.

123
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,700
They have a good solidarity.

124
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,700
That internet idol, Onishi-san..
I wonder if she is really popular.

125
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,210
She already has 200.000 followers.

126
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,190
200.000?!

127
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,560
This time, she will have a major debut.

128
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,280
That's why all her classmates are supporting her.

129
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,200
200.000?!

130
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,190
Atsumi~
- Atsumi~

131
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,180
Atsumi! Atsumi! Atsumi! Atsumi!

132
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,280
The first semester ends today.

133
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:41,190
Although your summer holiday will start tomorrow,
do not slack off and keep focused on your study.

134
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,190
Please, take responsibility of yourself!

135
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,690
Twelfth graders should be
ready to face the final exams.

136
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,740
They already announced that our
summer holiday will start tomorrow.

137
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,770
This doesn't feel like a summer holiday.

138
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:59,710
We should have done a class performance, right?

139
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:02,210
At the school festival?
- Yes.

140
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,700
Actually, I want to do it.

141
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,200
But it was hard to say it back then, right?

142
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,710
I also want to do it.

143
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:15,760
Eh, Goro-chan too?

144
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,210
We couldn't do such thing anymore,
since it's only done in youthful days.

145
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,700
Actually, I also want to do it!

146
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,220
Eh?!

147
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,680
Let's do that!
- Huh? It's too late to that.

148
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,690
Oh!
- That's what I mean!

149
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,230
Huh?

150
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,260
"That" thing!

151
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,180
Both of you wanna leap through time?

152
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,160
Yes!

153
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,190
It would be better if we decided to
do a class perfomance, so let's do it!

154
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,640
But, are you sure the other will agree?

155
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,710
You just have to persuade them,
we are going to help you!

156
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,680
Please..
- Please!

157
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,850
Please! Please! Please!

158
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,680
About the school festival..

159
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,690
What's happened?

160
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,670
Everyone, let's make a recital!

161
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:09,170
For our last school festival,
let's do it together!

162
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,270
Hey, Goro-chan.. Shohei..
Both of you, say something!

163
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,100
Why?

164
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,210
I hate doing a public performance.

165
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:23,210
You guys actually want to do it, right?

166
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,710
No, not at all.

167
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,180
What a traitor!

168
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,200
You're forcing us!

169
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,760
You said you're gonna help me!

170
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,190
You heard us saying it
few days from now, right?

171
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:42,190
But, it's the first time we heard it.

172
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:45,700
We have to persuade everyone to do it!

173
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,200
In such situation, there is no way
we could persuade them, right?

174
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,200
But Goro-chan, you're the one who
said that we can persuade them!

175
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,190
Did I say such thing?
- No, you didn't.

176
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,220
You said it, in the future!

177
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,280
Then he hasn't said it, yet.

178
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,680
Argh, this is not about
whether you said it or not!

179
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,180
It's because we are going to regret it
if we do nothing, do you understand?

180
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,680
Do you understand?!

181
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:15,730
I think, it will be a good memory for all of us.

182
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,180
So, we have to make it succeed!

183
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,680
To make it succeed,
I will do anything I can.

184
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,690
No one wants to do it?

185
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:33,200
We don't know what we are going to do,
so it's hard to answer your question.

186
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,770
About that, we haven't decided it yet.

187
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,120
How about performing a "Para Para" dance?

188
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,200
Like this.

189
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
We don't want to do unuseful things.

190
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,690
Eh?

191
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,690
Just like Hase said.

192
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:50,210
You really don't know a "Para Para" dance?

193
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,710
Let's do a "Para Para" dance!

194
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,730
Here..

195
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,690
Watermelon!

196
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,210
You like it?

197
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,690
No, I'm already beyond the level of "like".

198
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:08,680
Few days ago, I ate this for the first time.
Since then, I have become addicted to this.

199
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,190
Few days ago.. for the first time, huh?

200
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:18,290
Doing a choir or a dance would be hard because
there are some people who don't want to perform.

201
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,690
So, it would better be something
that needs some backstage jobs.

202
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,690
Ah~

203
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,200
Why you're the only one
who eat that watermelon?

204
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,200
You want it too?
- No, I don't!

205
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,720
I mean, you should also think something!

206
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,780
Cutting watermelons..
- Forget about the watermelon!

207
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,710
It's hard to ask someone to do
something that is not his interest.

208
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:47,200
If there is only few people who
enjoy it, wouldn't it feel too lonely?

209
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,710
Since we have the chance, I want us
to make a good memory together.

210
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:56,260
For me, I hate that "together" phrase.

211
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:56,900
Eh?

212
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,760
It's somewhat surprising.

213
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,700
In my school, only those who were
popular could enjoy such events.

214
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,700
So, I always thought that it's boring.

215
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:09,190
But looking at you guys now,
I start to regret it a little.

216
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:13,700
"How could we persuade those who don't
look interested to participate in that event?"

217
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,730
"How could we make them enjoy it?"

218
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,190
I think, they might also think about it.

219
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:23,860
Why don't you ask Yuri to participate?

220
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,690
"Yes, please!"
Do I look like a high schooler?!

221
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,690
It's impossible!
- Keita!

222
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,740
It must be hard for them..

223
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,790
There is not much time left until the festival, right?

224
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:43,190
It's not about the festival preparation.
I am talking about their love triangle.

225
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,440
Really?
Even Shohei?

226
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,190
Because Mihane-chan is so cute, right?

227
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,240
Let's make a drama!

228
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,690
Drama performance?
- It's the most tiring performance!

229
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,200
What is the title?

230
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,700
"Romeo and Juliet"

231
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,640
I get that you're worried about this.

232
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,730
But after we discussed a performance
that can be enjoyed by the whole class..

233
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,280
I think this is the best choice.

234
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,000
There will be some people who perform on the stage,
while the rest will prepare things at the backstage..

235
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,920
Such as making properties, costumes, or backgrounds.

236
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,680
I will make use of your specialities.

237
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,190
Is there anyone who don't want to do it?

238
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,190
Sorry!

239
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:44,730
No matter how, I want to be Romeo!

240
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:51,210
Sorry for being such a bother..

241
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:55,200
But please, spare my self-indulgence.

242
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,200
Please!

243
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,200
What are you doing, Goro-chan?
You're ruining my effort to persuade them!

244
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,240
If that's what you want, Asakura-kun..
Then, we have no other choice.

245
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,760
Eh?
- Indeed..

246
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,180
I'm going to have a competition soon,
so I don't know how far I can help.

247
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,710
It's okay, just do what you can.

248
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:14,120
Me too, I will do what I can!

249
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,540
Me too.
- Yosh, thank you!

250
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,860
Well then, the whole class will participate!

251
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,690
Okay~
- Yosh!

252
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:25,760
Why are you sulking?

253
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,700
Wouldn't it be faster if you persuade
them since the beginning, Goro-chan?!

254
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,360
Just look at how popular you are!

255
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,680
What a stupid fellow!

256
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,250
Are you angry.. or praising me?

257
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,690
I'm pissed off!

258
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:40,690
Ah, give up!
I give up.

259
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,460
Well..

260
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,180
Everyone becomes passionate, isn't it good?

261
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,700
Who wants to do these certain jobs?

262
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,200
Let me make the costumes!
- Costumes?

263
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,700
Then, me too!

264
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,460
How about the choreography?
- Well, I'm okay with that.

265
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,190
But, I will do it firmly!

266
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,440
Eh? Me?

267
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,190
In charge of properties?

268
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,680
Romeo will be potrayed by Goro-chan, right?

269
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,200
I think, Shohei would fit to be Laurence.

270
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,180
Eh?
- Nice idea!

271
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,200
I want to watch it!
- Sounds interesting..

272
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,690
It's okay, right?
- Me?

273
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:11,710
Yes.

274
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:15,280
Then, the one who will
potray Juliet's guardian is..

275
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,700
Me!

276
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,700
Sensei will be Juliet's guardian!

277
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,700
Is it okay if her guardian is a male?
- It's okay, we should add something new!

278
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,190
Sounds interesting!
- Indeed..

279
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,210
Okay then, Sensei will potray it.

280
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,190
Let's do it together!

281
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:34,690
Those who have not decided
any role, are Mihane and Aihara.

282
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,190
It's either potraying Juliet or in charge of
backgrounds, which one do you want?

283
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:46,690
Since it's my responsibility for choosing this
performance, I decided to accept anything left.

284
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,690
So, I leave it to Aihara-san.

285
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,190
Then, I will be Juliet.
- Huh?!

286
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:00,190
Sorry, forgive me..

287
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:03,690
Then it's decided, right?

288
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,700
Yeay, it's decided!

289
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,680
Is it okay for you to be
in charge of backgrounds?

290
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,750
Finally, thank you!

291
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,540
Juliet?

292
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,740
Why should you be Juliet?

293
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,740
*Wherefore art thou Juliet?*

294
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,860
Senpai, Romeo should be the one who say it!

295
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,700
It's not a dialogue!
I'm asking about your role!

296
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,200
Oh, my role?

297
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,180
You're really going to do it?

298
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:32,700
Because if I'm in charge of backgrounds,
I have to draw many things, right?

299
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,240
Right.

300
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,790
I hate being dirty, so it's impossible!

301
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,680
That's why you take the main role?

302
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,680
Better than being dirty.

303
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,180
Even so, you shouldn't be the main role!

304
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,420
Eh?

305
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,710
Where is Shohei?

306
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,210
I don't know.

307
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,600
Eh?

308
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,320
I'm going to look for him.

309
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,280
Give back the key.

310
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,690
Not there.

311
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,690
Oh, there he is!

312
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,080
Eh?

313
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,210
Where is Shohei?

314
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,690
He looks so busy.
- Eh?

315
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:28,180
Forget it, let's go!

316
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,200
Why are you angry?

317
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,700
Sorry, I'm a bit late..

318
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,680
Ah, they left without me.

319
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,180
I'm back!
- Welcome back!

320
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:53,690
We have a guest, looks like he wants
to talk to you about something.

321
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,690
Welcome back!

322
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,190
Eh?

323
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,710
Do you like Mihane-chan?

324
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,740
Eh?

325
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,680
Well, yes.

326
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,680
Then, stop it!

327
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,700
Eh?

328
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,190
When were you born?

329
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,710
Why suddenly ask?

330
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,190
You're not from this era, right?

331
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,690
Me too.

332
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,690
I came from the future.

333
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:41,200
Go back to the future!
What are you doing in this era?

334
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,750
I lost the drugs, so I couldn't go back.

335
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,690
Huh? Stupid..

336
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:49,690
So, what are you planning to do?

337
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:52,690
I'm extracting some ingredients..

338
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,680
..and make the drugs from the scratch.

339
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,700
You're a researcher?

340
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,190
What are you doing here?

341
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,690
I'm now living with my family.

342
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,770
I decided to live in this era.

343
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:12,560
Forget about me, it's more important for you
to give up your feeling for Mihane-chan.

344
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,220
Why?

345
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,690
You are not allowed fall in love
with someone from a different era!

346
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:20,690
You have the courage to say that, huh?

347
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,690
Although you already
make your own family here.

348
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,260
I'm warning you, just stop it!

349
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,760
Juliet will be potrayed by Aihara.

350
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,320
Who is Aihara?
Why not Mihane-chan?

351
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,260
Mihane-chan should potray it!
- She should, right?

352
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,040
Can't you do something about it?
- No, of course I can't.

353
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,940
Why don't you ask her to be Juliet?

354
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,360
Right!

355
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,360
Welcome!

356
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,250
Good afternoon..

357
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,250
To this side?
- Oh, okay..

358
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,740
What do you think?
- Looks good.

359
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,760
Ouch, it hurts!

360
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,760
Which one?
- This.

361
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,810
It hurts, don't touch it!

362
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:17,850
Are you okay, Hase-kun?

363
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,750
Why did you kill my best friend?

364
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,270
You should move too!

365
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:25,270
Takeda, do it properly!

366
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,260
Juliet use this potion only
to make herself look like dying.

367
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,080
Actually, she wants to keep alive.

368
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,750
How pitiful..

369
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,750
How pitiful!

370
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,260
Five days left!

371
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,260
To which side?
- Ah, this side.

372
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,250
Oh, this side?
- 1.. 2..

373
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,250
Once more.
- Once more?

374
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,290
Then, to this side.

375
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,740
So hot!

376
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,320
Four days left!

377
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:27,250
Hey, wait a sec!
Excuse me.

378
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,760
Let's measure his shoulder width!
- His shoulder width is 51cm.

379
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,760
 51cm.
- Not yet, hold still.

380
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,780
Can't you do it later?
- No, it should be now.

381
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,780
Three days left.

382
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,700
With this wing of love..

383
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,770
I will fly to the sky!

384
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,270
Okay~

385
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:47,260
Your soft lips couldn't call my name..
- Yeay, it's done!

386
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,260
Try it first!

387
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,280
Ah..

388
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,260
Argh, it's torn!

389
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,800
Sorry~

390
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,300
Romeo is not the only man
in the world, Juliet-sama!

391
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,260
Two days left!

392
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,260
A bit more, do your best!

393
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,270
One day left!

394
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,270
Would you want to dance with me?

395
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,290
Ah, sorry..

396
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:26,860
Okay, sorry..
Sorry!

397
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,750
Huh?
- Once more!

398
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,770
Just drink this potion, in two days..

399
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:39,250
This is too fragile.

400
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:45,270
Romeo.. Romeo..
Why should you be Romeo?

401
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:45,270
*It refers to "O.. Romeo, Romeo.. Wherefore art thou Romeo?" which basically
means the same, from Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" (Act 2 Scene 2)*

402
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:49,270
Romeo!

403
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,770
Sounds bad..
- She can't express it properly!

404
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,770
Romeo~

405
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,760
What is it?

406
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,760
"Because you think that I already died."

407
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,780
Because you think that I already died.

408
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,820
Put the dagger on your chest!
- Are you kidding me?!

409
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,250
Put the dagger on your chest..
- No, it's not part of dialogue.

410
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,240
Good job!

411
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,260
Finally, tomorrow is the day.

412
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:24,320
Although there are few things
that still make us worried.

413
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,320
Eh, few things?

414
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,760
There are few things, huh?

415
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:39,750
Because there is someone who doesn't interested
for the festival, everything seems useless now.

416
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:48,260
Hey, I'm talking about you!

417
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:51,760
Although you're not good at it,
at least you should do it properly!

418
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,260
I'm doing it properly, though..

419
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,250
You don't seem like doing it!

420
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:59,750
I have to face a national competition soon,
so actually I shouldn't waste my time doing this.

421
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:04,260
If you want to have that role, do it properly!
Watching you slack off gives me headache!

422
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,760
Well, it's because we only
have a little time for rehearsals.

423
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,260
As a main role, she has to remember lots of lines.

424
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,770
Those properties you broke, fix it yourself!

425
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,750
Enough..

426
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,760
Since the beginning, I don't get why
I should be in charge of properties!

427
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,760
Hase-kun, do you want to be on stage?

428
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,250
I should be Juliet instead..

429
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,270
It will be more funny.

430
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:31,250
Indeed, it will.
- It will be interesting!

431
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,270
I quit.

432
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:35,760
Eh? Wait..
- Aihara!

433
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,790
I already did what I can!

434
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:42,360
I practiced it until I couldn't
sleep, and that was the result.

435
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,360
No matter how hard I try, everyone says
that I don't seem like doing it properly.

436
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:53,250
Although I don't have the capability to do it,
I asked to be the main role. I'm so sorry.

437
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,250
Aihara, Sensei will teach you!

438
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,250
That's why I confronted you
(after you asked to be Juliet).

439
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:05,250
What should we do?

440
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,360
What should we do?
- It's tomorrow, right?

441
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,260
Hase-kun!

442
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,750
You really want to be Juliet?

443
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:19,250
No, we have to perform it
tomorrow. It's too impossible!

444
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:24,760
If it's not "tomorrow",
you want to do it, right?

445
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,270
Huh?

446
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,800
Eh, what's wrong?

447
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,080
Let's go back to the day
when we decided the roles!

448
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,570
Eh?
- I couldn't explain it there.

449
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,060
Follow me!
- How could we follow you?

450
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:43,060
During the first time-leap, I brought a turtle with me
and I was be able to leap through time with that turtle.

451
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:48,650
But human and turtle are different, right?

452
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:51,090
Shut up, and close your eyes!

453
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:54,590
Focus your mind to the moment
when we decided the roles!

454
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:10,140
Eh, what's wrong?
- Is this real?

455
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:14,060
What was that?
It feels amazing!

456
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,080
Let's do it!

457
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,580
It's already decided,
but.. so sorry..

458
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,560
This is too sudden, but..

459
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,550
I think it will be more interesting
if Juliet is potrayed by male student.

460
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,550
I think so.

461
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,580
As expected from Hase-kun!
So, would you potray Juliet?

462
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:34,580
Eh, why me?

463
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,580
Hase-kun, you actually
want to be on stage, right?

464
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:40,070
No, I don't!
- For real?

465
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:42,090
What do you mean?!

466
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,570
I shouldn't do such thing..

467
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:46,610
I'm fine being in charge of properties!

468
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:48,640
It's different from what he said before!

469
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,080
Then, Shohei should be "Juliet"..

470
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,080
…or, it's "Julio".

471
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,070
Me?

472
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:59,570
Asakura-kun and Fukamachi-kun
will potray Romeo and Juliet...?

473
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,060
Sounds perverted..

474
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,580
What do you imagine?

475
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:08,150
Indeed, sounds interesting!
- Huh?!

476
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,580
Then, who will be Laurence?

477
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,570
Me.

478
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:16,070
Okay, the only one left is..

479
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:23,060
Aihara, would you want
to be in charge of backgrounds?

480
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:27,150
I have no choice, right?

481
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:31,150
I'll do it then, I will.

482
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,570
Yosh, let's do our best!

483
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,080
This is the best I can do.

484
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,600
Sorry..

485
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,170
So, you're not bad at drawing?

486
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:53,570
I just hate being dirty.

487
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:56,580
Ew, so dirty!

488
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,080
Thank you for making
such amazing background!

489
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,570
We are so grateful for this!

490
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,570
If you don't mind with this..

491
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:08,610
I'm so touched!

492
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,610
"God's Hand"
- Amazing!

493
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:18,080
"Lesson Five: Confess Your Love Boldly!"

494
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,570
It's impossible..

495
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,590
Shohei, it's dinner time!

496
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,090
Okay~

497
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,610
I tried to cook some watermelon-based meal.

498
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,890
Amazing!

499
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,560
Bon appetit!

500
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:42,570
Yummy~
- Glad to hear it!

501
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:47,090
Watermelon? Watermelon..

502
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:49,650
"Why should you be watermelon?"

503
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:49,650
*Wherefore art thou watermelon?*

504
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,570
Forbidden love?

505
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:55,680
Even if I have to let you go,
I would keep loving you.

506
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,880
It's the effect of "Romeo and Juliet", right?

507
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,570
Eh, is there such effect?

508
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:03,060
If you have to face an obstacle,
your feeling will grow bigger.

509
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,180
So, you should better face it.

510
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,620
The power of love will help you!

511
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:12,050
You're right.

512
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:18,580
If you drink this potion, in two days..

513
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:21,560
..you will look like dying.

514
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:27,640
As long as I can be with Romeo
by then, I will do anything.

515
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,570
So, you have prepared yourself?

516
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,070
Yes.

517
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,580
Your soft lips couldn't call my name anymore.

518
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,590
The only love of my life..

519
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:49,560
Their love will definitely be able
to pass though this obstacle.

520
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:53,560
You must have been waiting
for me in a place with no obstacle.

521
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,060
I will also go with you!

522
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,060
The moment I realized it..

523
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:02,590
It's already too late.

524
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,590
Put your faith in love..

525
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:07,090
..and take this love thoroughly.

526
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,560
Here comes the day!

527
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,570
OK!
- 1.. 2..

528
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,070
A bit to the left..

529
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:25,110
Now, we just have to enjoy this festival and
make sure we have a successful performance!

530
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:29,060
Class 3-6, let's do our best!

531
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:39,060
My name is Julio,
Rome is there!

532
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:44,610
Lady Julio..

533
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:47,670
It's time for a morning "Para Para" dance!

534
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:55,090
Let's be passionate, Lady Julio!

535
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:06,580
Why should you be Romeo?

536
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:06,580
*Wherefore art thou Romeo?*

537
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:13,090
My grandfather gave me this name.

538
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:16,080
My family are fans of "Giant".

539
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:16,080
The Yomiuri Giants are the oldest team among the current Japanese professional teams,
while Hanshin Tigers is a professional baseball team especially popular in the Kansai region.

540
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,080
But, your family are fans of "Hanshin".

541
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,080
The Tigers-Giants rivalry is considered the national Japanese rivalry, on par with the New York Yankees
vs. the Boston Red Sox in Major League Baseball or Real Madrid vs. FC Barcelona in Spanish football.

542
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:24,600
Please, could you stop
being a fan of "Hanshin"?

543
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,650
Asakura-kun, quick!

544
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:29,070
You girls are helping me to change
costumes? I thought the boys will do this.

545
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:31,560
Why should you...?
- Ah, this is embarassing!

546
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:50,580
Tell me why..
Why did you kill my best friend?

547
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,440
Do I need a reason?!

548
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,070
Hey, Tybalt!
- Romeo!

549
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:18,090
Cool!

550
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:24,060
This potion will put you in an apparent death.

551
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:28,630
If I drink that potion,
I will look like dying, right?

552
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,670
Right!

553
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:35,070
Just make sure you use it
with a proper dosage.

554
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:37,570
Thank you, Laurence!

555
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,560
I wish you luck.

556
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:45,060
Thank you, Laurence!

557
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:52,160
It goes well until now.
- Let's hope the last act will go well too.

558
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,080
Julio!

559
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:05,070
Julio~

560
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,570
Why..

561
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:12,070
Why did you leave me?

562
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:18,070
Julio~

563
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,060
Oh.. that ball!

564
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:40,090
Really?

565
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:43,570
Is it just an act?
- Is he just pretending?

566
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:45,570
Mihane, what should we do?

567
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,580
Now, we have to help Goro-chan..

568
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:58,570
It looks bad!

569
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,060
This is bad..

570
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,060
He fainted!

571
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:12,060
Why is Romeo dead?

572
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,660
I won't forgive you for going there alone!

573
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,960
Sorry!

574
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,950
Sorry for making you guys worried.

575
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:28,470
Are you okay?

576
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:31,470
I thought I would die..

577
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:33,950
But, I'm okay!

578
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:36,010
I'm so sorry, everyone..

579
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:38,040
Glad to hear it.

580
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,540
Mihane, how is it?
Should we re-do it again?

581
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,450
Yes, right before the performance.

582
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:48,450
I will warn Goro-chan about that ball.

583
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:53,460
This time, we will definitely make it succeed!

584
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,960
Yosh..

585
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,500
Let's go back!

586
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:02,470
But, the moment Asakura-kun fainted..

587
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:04,740
His face looked weird, right?

588
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:09,460
And Shohei's last act, looked so cool.

589
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:12,460
It made everyone laugh so hard and
at the end, they gave us standing ovation.

590
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:16,280
When the drawing that Aihara-san made
with full of efforts, started broken..

591
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,020
Everyone saw it, right?
- Yes, we did.

592
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,450
It was all because my feet got stumbled.

593
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:23,470
I'm so sorry!

594
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:26,460
Thanks to you, our drama
could reach the climax.

595
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,960
What a cool response, Hase!

596
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,450
It's enough, right?

597
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:35,970
There is no need to re-do it.

598
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:39,040
Everyone smiles so brightly, right?

599
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,450
I have so much fun.

600
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,490
Right..

601
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:03,990
This is quite good.

602
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:10,780
The last school festival has finally come to
its end and everyone seems enjoying it.

603
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,950
I'm so happy!

604
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:16,460
Well then, for our miraculous failure..

605
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:18,980
Let's have a toast!

606
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,960
Yeay!

607
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,800
Here it is.
- Ah, thank you!

608
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,230
Ah, sorry..

609
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,500
Say "cheese"!

610
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,960
Amazing~

611
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:40,460
I'm glad to be involved in this muddy ship.

612
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:40,460
*he refers to their failed performance*

613
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:44,000
Youth without failure means nothing.

614
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,500
Even I can say something like that.

615
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,460
Muddy ship is the best!

616
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,750
Failure is.. good!

617
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,800
Failure is good!

618
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,470
Failure is good!

619
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,400
Failure is good!

620
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:12,160
Hase!
- Well done, Hase!

621
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,480
Keep it up!

622
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,450
It's good!
- Failure is good!

623
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,010
Failure is good!

624
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,060
OK!

625
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:39,800
So fun..

626
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,480
In this particular place,
I have something to say.

627
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,980
What is it?

628
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:52,450
Yoshiyama Mihane!

629
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:56,460
You, who always work hard..

630
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,460
..have made me fall in love.

631
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,480
Eh?
- Fall in love?

632
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,450
Fall in love?
- Really?

633
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:04,950
I love you!

634
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,460
Eh, what is this?

635
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:27,470
Would you be..

636
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:29,990
..my Juliet?

637
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:39,260
"Ah, I wish you wouldn't disappear.."

638
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:45,630
"..if </b>one day<b>, I could go back to that summer."

639
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:53,030
"While looking up to the blue sky.."

640
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:59,800
"I would stretch out my arms, although it </b>probably<b> means nothing."

641
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:06,360
"I don't </b>even<b> care about the destination."

643
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:17,000
"The scent that flutters through out that summer.."

644
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:23,760
"The sunflowers that keep facing towards the sun.."

645
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:30,500
"The side of your face staring at the fireworks.."

"</b>Those things have<b> managed to cut through my heart."

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:52,060
"I had always thought that our future.."

00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:56,330
"..would </b>be going to<b> continue forever."

649
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:03,160
"I wonder if this sadness would also disappear </b>someday<b>."

650
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:08,860
"Just like the summer we had spent together.."

651
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:12,800
"..when it finally came to its end."

652
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:19,930
"Ah, I wish you wouldn't disappear.."

653
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:25,130
"..and take me back to the middle of </b>that<b> summer."

654
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:30,560
"Just like how we fell in love that day.."

655
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,060
"I want to embrace you </b>tightly<b>."

656
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:43,460
"Ah, I wish you would never leave.."

Juliet!

00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:52,970
Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!

699
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:01,970
Juli..

700
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:04,460
Julie..

701
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:46,980
Juliet!

702
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:52,970
Kiss her!

703
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,960
Kiss her! Kiss her!
- Huh?

704
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,990
Kiss her! Kiss her!
- You guys are so noisy!

705
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:32,480
Kiss her!

706
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:48,960
I really like Mr.Yano's acting.

707
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,960
I'm talking about the radish!

708
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,470
I really like radish in Oden.

709
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,470
Oden is the quintessential Japanese comfort food. It is a kind of hot pot or stew consisting
mainly of daikon radish, konnyaku, and fish cakes stewed in a light soy flavored dashi broth.

710
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:57,950
Oh, really?
- Exactly!

711
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:01,600
If you don't mind, next time..

712
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:04,830
Would you mind teaching me how to act?

713
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,330
Okay? Please..
- I need more beer!

714
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:12,500
Please, teach me a little!
- Miura-san?

715
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:15,760
Just for a while,
are you embarassed?

716
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,960
Miura-san!

717
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,960
Miura-san, are you okay?
- Miura-san!

718
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,980
Call an ambulance!
- Okay!

719
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:23,010
Miura-san, Miura-san.
Hey, Miura-san!

720
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:25,050
Hang in there, Miura-san!

721
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,460
Eh?

722
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:58,950
There is no Shohei in these pictures.

723
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:18,450
Why?

724
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:22,970
There is no Shohei..

725
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,950
I'm so happy to hear your confession.

726
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:30,260
If she finds out the truth about me,
will this love come to its end?

727
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,360
Why don't you have any childhood photo?

728
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,360
Eh? Run away?

729
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,060
Is it wrong to live as I like?!

730
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,660
Goro-chan..
 - Goro!

731
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:39,700
I really love Mihane-chan!

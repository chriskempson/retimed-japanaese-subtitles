1
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,510
I am not good at saying goodbye.

2
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,510
I hate it.

3
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:49,260
Just like how I hate crying all by myself after the last day as
10th grader because I should move to another class as 11th grader.

4
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,350
Saying goodbye to friends..

5
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,350
...means saying goodbye with all
the precious moments, and it's painful.

6
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,260
For me, time is life.

7
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,750
Hey, will you cry?

8
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,250
If our time together, comes to its end.

9
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,750
Keita, from now on, could you
please take care of your mother?

10
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,840
Of course!

11
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,750
Listen to what she says, and talks
to her about a lot of interesting things!

12
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,760
Of course, I will!

13
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,830
Thank you.

14
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,080
Mi-kun, you should also take
care of Mom forever, okay?

15
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,600
Okay, cheers!

16
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,760
Also, I should be careful not to do
anything that will make you hate me.

17
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,260
Eh?

18
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,810
You know, my dad left me
because he hates me.

19
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,340
No, that's wrong.

20
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,250
It's true, because I remember.

21
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,620
7  Years Ago

22
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,280
Hey, wait a sec!
Give me the money!

23
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,060
Ouch!

24
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,920
Because of you, he runs away!

25
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,920
Stupid!

26
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,760
Hmm, why did you cry?

27
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,820
It's not your business!

28
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,770
It's not your business.

29
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,250
Who the hell are you?!

30
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,870
She already paid her debt, right?

31
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,620
Eh, why are we here?

32
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,270
Yes, her debt has been paid.

33
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,850
Bon appetit!

34
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,720
Bon appetit!

35
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,260
Miura.. Miura..

36
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,300
Would you mind to be called "Mi-kun"?

37
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,770
Mi-kun!

38
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,770
Sounds good!

39
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:33,270
It's been 7 years since then,
and Keita has grown up.

40
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,440
It's been 7 years, huh?

41
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,250
My internal organs have been aging
much faster than Keita's growth.

42
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,790
It's been so critical.

43
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:48,280
When I heard about the result,
I think it was all my fault.

44
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,760
No, it's not true.

45
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,280
I'm afraid that all food I have ever
cooked for you are not healthy.

46
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,750
They said you're aging too fast and
there is no medical explanation for it?

47
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,250
It doesn't make sense.

48
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,270
Whatever it is, it makes me worried.

49
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,280
When I wake up in the morning..

50
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,280
I'm afraid that Mi-kun has gone away.

51
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,460
So, if I see you whenever I open my eyes..

52
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,220
It feels like a miraculous encounter!

53
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:31,730
The happiness from having such encounter usually
only last for a while, but I can feel it every day.

54
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,750
I'm so grateful!

55
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,660
That night, I was trying to find out
the proper way to say goodbye.

56
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,740
Soumen.. Soumen..

57
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,740
Soumen (素麺) are very thin white Japanese noodles made of wheat flour, less than 1.3 mm in
diameter. The noodles are usually served cold, so it's especially popular during summer time.

58
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,300
Isn't it hot?
Want to have a ride?

59
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,760
No, thank you.
I walk as a physical excercise.

60
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,250
I need your help, Mihane-chan.

61
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,750
Eh?

62
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,250
Actually, I came from the 22nd century.

63
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,270
What?

64
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,140
I came to collect some environmental samples.

65
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,280
But, after I met Yuri..

66
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,270
I decided to live in this era
and take care of my family here.

67
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:23,820
But few years after, I started to
feel something strange in my body.

68
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:29,760
When I did a medical check up, the result shows
that my internal organs have been aging too fast.

69
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,260
Seems it's caused by the energy produced
whenever the time does a self-cleaning.

70
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,770
Soon, all people from the future
would be swept away by time.

71
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,770
I can not live any longer.

72
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,770
Eh?

73
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:49,260
You're going out with Shohei, right?

74
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,270
You should break up with him.

75
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,770
Because, Shohei also came from the future.

76
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,780
Ah, really?

77
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,290
Anyway, that was a long introduction..

78
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:08,320
Why don't you say it like in a drama? Like,
"You are siblings that were separated at birth!"

79
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,770
Simple, but interesting.

80
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,750
Eh?

81
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,260
You just want me to break up with Shohei, right?

82
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,260
No, that is not what I want.

83
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,600
I want you to make sure
that our family didn't exist.

84
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,590
Eh?

85
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:29,770
I want you to leap through time and
make sure our family didn't exist.

86
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:33,720
What do you mean?

87
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:38,260
7 years ago, I want you to
make sure I didn't met Yuri.

88
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,780
Wait, I can't accept this!

89
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,580
I am not giving it to you.
- Eh?

90
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,770
Pay her debt with that money,
and even if she didn't meet me..

91
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,140
Yuri is so pretty.

92
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,940
I bet she would meet another
man who could make her happy.

93
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:13,000
She would be happier than now.
Please, lend me your help!

94
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,240
Impossible!

95
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,780
Moreover, I never said that
I can leap through time!

96
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,480
Stop pretending!
You can do it, right?

97
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,900
When you leap through time,
you always say "Nyo~", right?

98
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,960
Huh? Nyo~?

99
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,800
Oh, I see..

100
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,780
It might give you pain,
please be careful..

101
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,560
I said, I can not leap through time!

102
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,750
Hey, Mihane-chan..
Please help me!

103
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,240
Everything that Miura-san said..
do you think it was all a lie?

104
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,480
Sounds like a poor lie.
- You're right.

105
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,120
But, he knows about the "Nyo~".

106
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,800
He lied to you.
- Yes, he did!

107
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,500
Shohei came from the future?
It's definitely impossible.

108
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,270
Like I said..
- So, what are you?

109
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,740
Then, I'm a newcomer here.

110
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,290
Yoshiyama-san..

111
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,060
You may not know me..

112
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,980
I know you.

113
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,260
Onishi-san.

114
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,480
I am going to move to
another school in Tokyo.

115
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,780
Eh?

116
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:31,250
Since long, I have always wanted to be your friend.

117
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,850
One day, let me take a photo of you!

118
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:53,280
8.. 9.. 10..

119
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,250
Here is your photo.
- Thank you.

120
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,270
Wow, I look good in this photo!

121
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,280
I don't know why
you made up that lie.

122
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,780
Why I lied? There is no reason,
because I was not lying at all.

123
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,770
My body will reach its limit soon.

124
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,260
Tonight, I am going to have my last dinner.

125
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,250
But they do not know about this,
they think it's our usual dinner.

126
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,250
The moment they sleep,
I will leave them.

127
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,660
You're running away.

128
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,760
I think, each encounter has its own responsibility.

129
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,260
Responsibility?

130
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,320
You should say goodbye.

131
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,270
No, I can't.

132
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:06,290
We can't say goodbye to each other.

133
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,860
Because we are all so close.

134
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,360
Then, you should stay together!

135
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,270
The best thing to do is to make sure
our encounter never happened.

136
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,560
You can leap through time, right?

137
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,100
I know you can.

138
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,620
Please, lend me your help!

139
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,250
Because I really love my family!

140
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,500
I don't want them to be sad
because of my own problem.

141
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,820
I want them to keep smiling.

142
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,060
Please..

143
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:37,280
For me, my family are more precious
and irreplaceable than my own life.

144
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,780
Make sure that encounter didn't exist!

145
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:47,270
Lately, I can't leap to the right time.

146
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,780
I don't know if I can
go back to 7 years ago.

147
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,280
But, you want to do it?

148
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:02,260
But please don't run away
from your own family!

149
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,780
Thank you.

150
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,220
Sorry for waiting!

151
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,000
Bon appetit!
- Looks delicious!

152
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,280
This is for Keita.
- Thank you.

153
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,780
This is for you.
- Thank you.

154
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,270
This is the best!

155
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,870
What's wrong?
- Eh?

156
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,270
Well..

157
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,270
There is something I have to say.

158
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,770
Our family will end today!

159
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,770
Eh?

160
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,100
End?

161
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,580
This family that we have for
these 7 years is going to disappear.

162
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,880
But, don't worry..

163
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,280
All of us will restart our life,
starting from 7 years ago.

164
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,210
Although we would not be together..

165
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,860
No one would feel sad or lonely,
although we won't meet each other.

166
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,760
Because since the beginning,
we would never meet each other.

167
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,680
Is this because you have
to be hospitalized next week?

168
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,760
Doctor said it will be just another
medical check up, you're exaggerating!

169
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,330
I want you to know..

170
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:23,520
..that I love both of you, so much.

171
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,750
I love you.

172
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:31,120
If it's possible, I want us to
stay together forever.

173
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,580
But, being together will only make you sad.

174
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,720
It will give you painful memories,
that's why.. you should understand.

175
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:45,740
Keita, help your mother..

176
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:53,260
Live your life to the fullest!

177
00:13:54,350 --> 00:14:00,850
Then, find someone you love.

178
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,770
To live, is to love someone.

179
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:11,750
Both of you have taught me that.

180
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:16,720
You're just going to have an endoscopic examination,
but you say it as if you're going to say goodbye forever.

181
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,560
For being my family during these 7 years..

182
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,340
Thank you so much!

183
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,270
We are family.

184
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,660
I am so happy for that!

185
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,580
What are you saying?

186
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:39,000
We will be family forever, right?

187
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,250
Forever, as family!

188
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:51,260
Mi-kun, you're crying..
You're not cool!

189
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,640
Don't cry, Dad!

190
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,940
Okay~

191
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:03,350
Because you're a Dad, in our family.

192
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,260
Keita..

193
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,440
Ah!

194
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,280
Here.
- What is it?

195
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,770
Our photos from that day.
- Oh..

196
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:22,460
We look good!

197
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,560
We're the best family in Japan.

198
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,780
No, in the world.
Even in the universe!

199
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:46,210
It's sad to see your last dinner.

200
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:49,710
If you our encounter didn't exist,
all the sadness would be gone.

201
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,800
I wonder if having farewell
is the best thing to do.

202
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,920
Next is your turn, Mihane-chan.

203
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,730
Eh?

204
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,950
How should you break up with Shohei?

205
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,940
I have no intention
to break up with Shohei.

206
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,470
People from the future
won't have a long life.

207
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,820
Like I said, he is my childhood friend!

208
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,810
It's hypnotism.

209
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,950
Hypnotism?

210
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,450
Could you remember
his face when he was a kid?

211
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,660
Go away!

212
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,980
Go away!

213
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,980
Stop it, go away!
Are you alright, Mihane?

214
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,950
Mihane, it's okay now.

215
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,430
That was Goro-chan..

216
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:01,930
So, the one who was desperately trying
to save me that day is.. Goro-chan?

217
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,450
Not Shohei..

218
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:30,430
♪～ Poetry of life.. ～♪

219
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:36,570
♪～ ..by a woman who falls in love. ～♪

220
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,740
Eh, where is Goro-chan?

221
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,510
What is he doing?
- He goes to a cram school.

222
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,510
7 years from now, you asked
me to give you this photo.

223
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,540
Stop!

224
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,540
Hey, wait!

225
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,510
I don't need this.

226
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,380
Welcome!

227
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,520
Good afternoon!

228
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,020
Today, we have to announce something.

229
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,780
We are going to be married.
- Eh?!

230
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,360
We want you to be
witness in our wedding.

231
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,680
Oh, I see.
- Congratulations!

232
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,960
Thank you so much.
- It's all thanks to Take-chan's family.

233
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,260
It's surprising!

234
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,520
Yano-sensei, you did it!
- Don't tell anyone for now, okay?

235
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,620
But, we have to think how to tell the others.

236
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,040
Hey, wait a sec!

237
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:18,600
Who are you actually?

238
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,520
Huh?

239
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,530
What do you mean?

240
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:28,140
You want to hypnotize me again
and change my memories?

241
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,040
You knew it?

242
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,680
My real name is..

243
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,720
Ken Sogoru.

244
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,700
My era has different environmental condition.

245
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,200
There is only snow all year round.

246
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:02,790
The last four seasons only
existed in 21st century.

247
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,700
I came to experience a summer season.

248
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,710
We only planned to stay for few hours, but..

249
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,690
Accidentally, I lost the drug for the time-leap.

250
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,250
Eh? You lost it?

251
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,160
It's a small bottle with a greed lid..

252
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,200
..filled with purple fluid.

253
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,210
Do you know it?
- How could I know?

254
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,210
Of course, you don't.

255
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,710
Then?
- Ah, then..

256
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,720
I tried to collect some chemical ingredients..

257
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,770
..which could only be done by
mixing some materials in this era.

258
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,720
I should have succeeded, but..

259
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,230
Did you make another mistake?

260
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,730
Mihane, you ruined all the potions.

261
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,220
..at the school lab.

262
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,160
On July 7th, after the class ended..

263
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,810
Eh?

264
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,200
So, you're saying that you
can't go back because of me?

265
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,720
It's your fault..

266
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,220
Well, it's true.

267
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,210
But, thanks to you..

268
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,210
We fall in love with each other, right?

269
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,200
Mihane?

270
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,210
So, you won't go back?

271
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,220
I'm still trying to make the drugs.

272
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,220
It will be done soon.

273
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,710
But, don't worry..

274
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,900
I will stay in this era.

275
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,710
Eh?

276
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,240
Eh?

277
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,700
I thought you would be happy.

278
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,260
You should go back to the future!
Because if you don't, you will..

279
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,210
I want to stay with you, Mihane.

280
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,730
Even Miura-san..

281
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:21,200
If he really treasures his family..

282
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,200
Until the end, he should have stayed in this era.

283
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,360
Go back!

284
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:35,810
Although this is my own decision,
am I too troublesome for you?

285
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,720
Go back!

286
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,210
Go back to the future!

287
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,220
Mihane, help me..
- Huh?

288
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:03,960
Okay!

289
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,210
Take that.
- This?

290
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,710
Yes.
- Okay..

291
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,700
Ah, wait a sec..

292
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,200
You're too careless..
- What are you doing?

293
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,280
Why there is a newspaper here?!

294
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,210
First, you should apologize!

295
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:27,210
I just need to turn back time.

296
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,690
Eh?

297
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:38,690
Why?

298
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,720
What are you doing?
- Why?

299
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,200
Why?
Turn back!

300
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,770
Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!

301
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,320
Come on..

302
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,400
"For you, who do not know about love.."
(Koi wo Shiranai Kimi e)

303
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,220
You're going to leave?

304
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,220
Eh?

305
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:23,710
Stir like cutting it thoroughly.

306
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,710
Here.

307
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,250
Yes, like that.

308
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,280
About me..

309
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,720
You already realized it?

310
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,220
When you didn't come home
that night, I call the police.

311
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,720
I was so worried.

312
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,210
They said, I do not have a son.

313
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,720
Mom..

314
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:22,260
Don't you want to ask who I am?

315
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,720
I'm happy to have you.

316
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,220
I know, you're not a bad kid.

317
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:37,220
Thank you for all delicious food!

318
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,710
When will you leave?

319
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,230
Tomorrow..

320
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,770
Then you should wash the dishes
tonight, to pay your rental fee!

321
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,680
Mom!

322
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,710
What's wrong?

323
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:33,220
There is no reaction.

324
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,720
Eh?

325
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,220
Really?

326
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,720
This is bad!

327
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:51,220
I will grow old and die in this era?!

328
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,710
This is great!

329
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:56,480
I can stay in this era!

330
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,360
This stupid guy!

331
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,230
Amazing!

332
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,730
Yeay~

333
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:16,710
Mihane..

334
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,720
I have a good news!

335
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:43,220
After the last stage of the drug
making process, it has no reaction!

336
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,210
What's wrong?
Be happy for me..

337
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,250
Let's be happy together!

338
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,250
I can't be happy.

339
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,200
Shohei won't have a long life..

340
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,720
..and it's all my fault.

341
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,710
If only I didn't ruin your experiment..

342
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,710
You must have been back to the future.

343
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,290
I shouldn't have felt it.

344
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:21,210
Eh, what?

345
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,220
I shouldn't have fallen in love with you!

346
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:41,780
In the exam, there will be a lot of
problems that use 1/12 formula.

347
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,210
Learn more about it!

348
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,700
Is there something you don't understand?

349
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:55,770
I said something that I didn't mean.

350
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,730
And, then?

351
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,720
The way I said goodbye..

352
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,210
..was wrong.

353
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:12,760
If you realize your mistake, then you
won't make the same mistake twice.

354
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,310
Mayuka, let's go!
- Okay..

355
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:48,210
Is it possible..

356
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,220
Small bottle with green lid,
which filled with purple fluid.

357
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,280
Shohei!

358
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,710
Shohei!

359
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,210
He is not here.

360
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,230
Should I drink this?

361
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,210
Although it's quite hazy,
but I'm sure this scent..

362
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:19,220
I should go back to the school lab,
on July 7th, after the class ended.

363
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,220
Before I make that wish.

364
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:26,720
I remember something important,
so I decided not to go back.

365
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,770
If I go back to that day..

366
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:37,220
I will make my first love disappear.

367
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,710
Isn't it just a first love?

368
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,200
Isn't it a love that will be forgotten?!

369
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:51,800
One day, first love will only become
something that you use as jokes.

370
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,800
I have nothing to lose.

371
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,200
For the sake of my precious someone..

372
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:03,700
I should be glad to throw away my first love!

373
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,220
It's just a first love!

374
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,720
Although, he is just my first love..

375
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,200
Please..

376
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,220
Please! Please! Please!

377
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:34,000
08 August

378
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:31,230
On July 7th, at the lab,
after the class ended.

379
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,730
Please, take me back!

380
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,860
Would you be my Juliet?

381
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:49,230
Julio!

382
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,300
Nyo~ Ouch..

383
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:18,630
07 July

384
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,690
Shohei..

385
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,950
You're here, right?

386
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,020
Hey..

387
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,970
Hey, where are you?

388
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,480
There you are.

389
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,480
Why are you here?

390
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,490
I come to make sure you
can go back to 22nd century.

391
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:32,000
Before this..

392
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:36,000
I ruined your experiment.

393
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:43,960
Because of that, you can't
go back to the future.

394
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,450
I smell that scent and I fainted.

395
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,450
Thanks to that drug,
I can leap through time.

396
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,560
I had a lot of fun.

397
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,460
That scent is from a lavender, huh?

398
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,970
You may not know it, but..

399
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:37,470
We were a couple.

400
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,470
Eh?

401
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,540
Sounds weird, right?

402
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,540
Because it would happen
someday in the future.

403
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,480
You started to like me..

404
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:05,480
..and arbitrarily, you changed my memories.

405
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,010
So cruel..

406
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,570
Sorry.

407
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,470
You don't have to say sorry!

408
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,470
You haven't done it yet.

409
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,960
This is you, at the first time
you ate a frozen pineapple.

410
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,480
You smiled brighter than
when you saw the fireworks.

411
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,980
But, after this..

412
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,490
There was a decoration tower fell upon you.

413
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,970
Eh, really?

414
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,470
But, I leapt through time and saved you.

415
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,140
You're safe.

416
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,970
When you saw me crying because
I was relieved, you laughed so hard.

417
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,460
Why you're the only one
who wears a sport uniform?

418
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,960
15 minutes before..

419
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,990
For the first time..

420
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,990
You kissed me.

421
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:46,460
I was trying to avoid you,
but then I fell into the pool.

422
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,460
Sorry for avoiding you that day.

423
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,470
This is taken from our class'
performance at the school festival.

424
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,220
Shohei was Julio.

425
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,480
Julio?

426
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,480
"Romeo and Julio"

427
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:13,040
At the closing party, in front
of everyone, you confessed to me.

428
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:16,060
I actually hate such thing..

429
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,980
But..

430
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,960
I was so happy.

431
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,460
This..

432
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,470
We had a picnic.

433
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,470
We went to an amusement park.

434
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,980
We also had dinner in your house.

435
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,980
Entered the pool at night.

436
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:46,460
Your weird face..

437
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,980
What is it?

438
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,980
Looks terrible, right?

439
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,050
No matter how many times you did it..

440
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,470
I don't want to have a boyfriend like that.

441
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,490
People who came from the future..

442
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,970
..shouldn't stay too long in this era.

443
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:17,470
To make sure you can go back to the future..

444
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,990
There is no other way but to come here.

445
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,480
But, Shohei..

446
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,980
You said, you don't want to go back.

447
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,550
Even if your life will be shortened,
you want to stay with me.

448
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,550
I don't want it.

449
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:41,990
I don't want your life to be shortened.

450
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,960
That's why..

451
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,970
Go back!

452
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,040
I see.

453
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,460
Is it okay for you..

454
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,980
..if I go back to the future?

455
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:11,470
I've been trying to hold back.

456
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,540
But, if you ask me like that..

457
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,840
I don't want you to go back!

458
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:20,480
Of course, I want you to stay with me!

459
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,970
Because, you are my first love.

460
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:28,470
I don't want to lose you.

461
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,970
But, if you don't go back to the future..

462
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,050
You're going to die!

463
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:47,970
So, I give up..

464
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,460
I see.

465
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,070
Take this.

466
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,680
If the drug is done, you should go back!

467
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:11,460
Go back quickly!

468
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,490
Hey, this one..

469
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,040
You wrote it, right?

470
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:12,750
"For you,

471
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:12,750
who do not

472
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:12,750
 know about love.."

473
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,980
This photo album has no
photographer's name on it.

474
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,460
This is..

475
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:35,060
..yours, right?

476
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,080
"For you, who do not know about love.."
(Koi wo Shiranai Kimi e)

477
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,000
"For you, who do not know about love.."
(Koi wo Shiranai Kimi e)

478
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:42,470
Not yet. But from now on, you are going
to make this photo album, Mihane.

479
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:47,770
"For you, who do not know about love.."
(Koi wo Shiranai Kimi e)

480
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,970
These are good photos, right?

481
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,970
This is a very beautiful album.

482
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,580
Right, it's all thanks to Mihane.

483
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:15,510
"Ah, I wish you wouldn't disappear.."

484
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:21,880
"..if </b>one day<b>, I could go back to that summer."

485
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:29,280
"While looking up to the blue sky.."

486
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:36,050
"I would stretch out my arms, although it </b>probably<b> means nothing."

487
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:42,610
"I don't </b>even<b> care about the destination."

Which one?
- Harvard!

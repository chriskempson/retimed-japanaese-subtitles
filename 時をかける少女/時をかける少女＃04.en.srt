1
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,430
Eh? Wait a sec..
What's wrong with you?

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,430
Hey, you're so heavy!

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,240
Let's go on a picnic..

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,240
Picnic.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,950
Eh?

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,510
I prefer go to an amusement park.

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,410
The three of us will go, right?
- No..

8
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,930
Just the two of us.

9
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,410
Eh, how about Shohei?

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,910
We always have fun together, right?

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,400
Let's have fun without him!

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,410
If it's just the two of us,
it will be more fun.

13
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,960
Somehow, your voice sounds weird.

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,960
Because, we are now a couple.

15
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,900
Eh?

16
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,900
Yoshiyama Mihane!

17
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,920
You who always work hard, have made me fall in love.

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,940
Amazing~

19
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,990
I love you!

20
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,420
Would you be my Juliet?

21
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,920
Romeo!

22
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,410
I hope you do not runaway from this.

23
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,910
I want a love that can't disappear.

24
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,920
If she finds out the truth about me,
will this love come to its end?

25
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,910
Her memory..

26
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,430
..can be easily changed by me.

27
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,520
Like a Kokeshi, somehow..
- Kokeshi, huh?!

28
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,520
Kokeshi are Japanese dolls made from wood, have a simple trunk and
an enlarged head with a few thin, painted lines to define the face.

29
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,860
No, that's me. Shohei was
desperately trying to save you.

30
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,990
Shohei was desperately trying to save me.

31
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,930
Love that is made from a lie..

32
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,900
Could it be a real love?

33
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,910
You slept too long.

34
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,510
Go on a picnic feels nice, but..

35
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,010
..going to an amusement park seems quite fun.

36
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,920
Then, let's re-start the day!

37
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,410
Eh? Really?

38
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,910
Of course.

39
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:06,510
"Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo"
(The Girl who Leapt Through Time)

40
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,750
Episode 4

41
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,930
Amusement Park!

42
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,400
Amazing!
- Let's ride a roller coaster!

43
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,640
What is that?
- Eh?!

44
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,970
You don't know what a roller coaster is?

45
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,900
Because this the first time
I go to an amusement park.

46
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,910
You've been wasting your life!
- You're kidding me, right?

47
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,410
Let's go!

48
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,910
Let's learn about the grammatical structure of "so that"!

49
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,910
First, start from its literal meaning.

50
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:42,400
"The water was so cold."

51
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,950
This means, the water..

52
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,910
Looks great!

53
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:53,910
Eh?

54
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,400
I won't let you escape!

55
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,900
Ride on, please..
- Okay~

56
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,990
Well then, get ready and fly to the paradise!

57
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,430
Let's go!
- Don't jinx us!

58
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,400
Oh, no!

59
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,920
Stupid!

60
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,920
Unbelievable!
- We're going down!

61
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,920
Unbelievable..

62
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,920
Once more! Once more!
- No, please don't! Really, I can't..

63
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,920
Mommy~

64
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,900
Genetically, I am not suitable for this!

65
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,410
Once more! Once more!
- It's impossible for me, please don't..

66
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,910
Encore~ Encore~

67
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,910
Encore..

68
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,410
Or maybe, we should stop doing this..

69
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,910
Right?

70
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,420
Delicious!

71
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,950
Yummy~

72
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,950
They don't see us, right?

73
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,410
Yup.

74
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:19,430
But, seems they're enjoying their youthful days.

75
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,430
You stare too much.

76
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,420
Thanks for the food!

77
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,440
Ouch..

78
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,990
Eeeh!? They both just
fell down at the same time!

79
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,910
Your voice is too loud!

80
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,410
Bon appetit!

81
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,910
Looks yummy..

82
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,930
They suddenly fell..
- They're gonna see us!

83
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,410
Hamburger, Aha~
Hamburger..  O, yeay!

84
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,800
Relative pronouns..

85
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:53,420
You should also identify which
phrase that follows the word "who".

86
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,420
See this encircled verb?

87
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,420
That cloud looks like a lion.

88
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,930
Like a zoo in the sky!

89
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:08,960
Ah, there.. It looks like
a fat kangaroo, right?

90
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:16,910
At the left, either it looks like an elephant's
trunk or.. oh, it's a standing polar bear!

91
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,910
Welcome back!
- I heard the rumor..

92
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,430
You passed the mock exam for medical school?

93
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,430
Seems that was just because of luck.

94
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,920
If you become a doctor,
please take care of Mihane!

95
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,920
If it's Mihane-chan, we would be
so glad to welcome her in this house.

96
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,920
If it does happen, we will give
you a hair coloring for free.

97
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,950
Really? Okay then, although my daughter is
not a smart girl, please take care of her!

98
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,900
You're willing to swap your
daughter with a hair coloring?

99
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,900
So cruel!

100
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,420
Instead for studying for her final exams, today
Mihane goes to an amusement park with her friend.

101
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,410
Maybe, she is ready for the exam.
- No, I don't think she is ready.

102
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,430
She shouldn't play too much, right?

103
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,900
Welcome!

104
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,440
Same cut as usual?

105
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,410
Yosh!

106
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
Looks pretty.

107
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,420
Although I am the one who
made you look pretty..

108
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,450
What are you doing?
- Nothing.

109
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,020
Go study, then. I will let you
know when dinner is ready.

110
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,920
Ah, I forget to buy Natto!

111
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,920
Nattō (納豆) is a traditional Japanese food made from soybeans fermented with
Bacillus subtilis var. natto. It has powerful smell, strong flavor, and slimy texture.

112
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,920
I don't want to take the entrance exam.

113
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,420
Eh?!

114
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,410
So, I won't enter a medical school.

115
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,410
I also won't go to college.

116
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:58,410
Dad!

117
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,900
Okay..

118
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,920
Welcome!

119
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,410
Eh, where is the customer?

120
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,410
Goro said, he won't take the entrance exam.

121
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,910
Eh?

122
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,320
If you don't want to go to college,
what are you planning to do?

123
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,470
I am going to do what I want.
- Doing what you want?

124
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,470
You don't say that you're planning
to take over this barbershop?

125
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,910
Forget it, you don't suit for this!

126
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,960
Don't decide it for me.

127
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,280
This barbershop has no future..

128
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,420
Think about your future thoroughly!
- I have made my decision.

129
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,400
Why?

130
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,420
Are you worried about the tuition fee?

131
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,420
That's not it.

132
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,410
I'm not interest to do it.

133
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,910
Why are you not interested?

134
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,930
Why do you want to take over this shop?

135
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,990
Since I was a kid, it has been my dream.

136
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,410
What kind of dream is that?

137
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,910
Don't just decide your future based
on things like dream or interest!

138
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,410
Face your capability!

139
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,430
It's so unfortunate to have parents who
don't want to support their son's dream.

140
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,940
So unfortunate!

141
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,910
So, what? You're saying that parents
should support all their child's dreams?

142
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,930
But, I don't think so.

143
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:18,930
Don't mistake your temporary feeling for a dream!

144
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,440
Then, let me ask you..

145
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,420
So, you're going to disregard
your parent's expectation?

146
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,980
You piss me off!
- Dad..

147
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,430
Is it wrong to live my life as I like?!

148
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,910
Don't decide it as you like!

149
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,410
Because "expectation" is too troublesome!

150
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,930
How dare you...!

151
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,390
You really want to be a barber, huh?

152
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,410
I have said that since long, right?

153
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,430
I got it.

154
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,500
But, I won't give this shop!

155
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,500
If you really want to do it,
do it somewhere else!

156
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,420
I got it.

157
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:11,080
Paella is the best!
It tastes good!

158
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,610
Yummy~

159
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,650
Because I was so fired up,
I tried to cook it since yesterday.

160
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,550
Since yesterday?
Thank you so much!

161
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:20,550
It's okay, I'm happy to see
someone eating my food.

162
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,580
Yummy, wait a sec..
what is this?

163
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,080
I wrapped apples with porks.

164
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,070
Is it a film camera?

165
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:34,640
Yes, this one is best!

166
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,060
May I take a photo of you?
- Yes, of course!

167
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,040
Okay..

168
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,580
That kind of camera is hard to find, right?

169
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,550
Ah, indeed.

170
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,560
Anyway..

171
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,570
I don't have any photo
from Shohei's childhood.

172
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:56,660
Although we have always been together
since we were small, I think it's strange.

173
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:00,660
Shohei's childhood photos?

174
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,570
I wonder if we have it here..

175
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,070
Eh, don't you have it?

176
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,550
In family album, for example..

177
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,070
I think we have it,
eh wait a sec..

178
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:16,570
Shohei, why don't you have any childhood photo?

179
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:51,550
This so delicious, what is this?

180
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,570
I wrapped apples with porks.

181
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:59,070
Eh, you wrapped apples with porks?
How could you make it?

182
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,080
Mihane, your phone is ringing.

183
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,050
Here.

184
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:23,050
Yes?
- Ah, Mihane?

185
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,070
You're not with Goro-kun, right?

186
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:28,090
Goro-chan?
No.

187
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:31,160
I'll let you talk to Goro-kun's mom, okay?

188
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,070
It's me, sorry for calling you suddenly..

189
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:37,590
Goro hasn't come back yet,
since he left our house.

190
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,550
Eh, runaway?

191
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,570
His phone?

192
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:45,080
He left it. If he is fine,
then we won't be worried.

193
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,630
What if he gets an accident..

194
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,070
Where does a high schooler usually go?
How about a manga cafe?

195
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,070
A manga café (漫画喫茶/マンガ喫茶, read as mangakissa, which "kissa" being short for "kissaten", means cafe or
cafeteria) is a kind of cafe in Japan where people can read manga. People pay for the time they stay in the cafe.

196
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,060
It's summer..

197
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,000
Maybe, he just wanted to sleep outside.
- Sleep outside?

198
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,060
Mihane, would you ask your friends about him?

199
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,560
Sorry for bothering you..

200
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,130
Goro-chan!

201
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,550
Goro-chan!

202
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,550
Where did you go?

203
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:15,060
Are you kidding me?

204
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,560
Thank you so much!

205
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,060
Goro!

206
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,560
Hello, I haven't found him yet.

207
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:38,000
If something happened to
Asakura-kun, I will die.

208
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,050
If you die, it will be more troublesome!

209
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:44,070
Goro!

210
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,100
Goro!

211
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,600
Heck, where are you?!

212
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,550
Where did he go?

213
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:09,560
I think, he would feel like a loser
if he come back too soon.

214
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,110
There is no choice but
to leap through time, huh?

215
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,980
To the moment he left his house.

216
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,110
Let's go!

217
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,570
Eh?

218
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:26,040
Your face is telling me that
you don't want me to go with you.

219
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,560
I don't make that kind of face, though..

220
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,580
Though?

221
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,590
Probably, I should better go off alone.

222
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,090
Why?

223
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,560
Because.. Goro-chan would feel troubled?

224
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,840
Why?

225
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,060
Although I also worry for him?

226
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:51,260
Wait, is it possible that..

227
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,590
Goro started to hate me?

228
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,140
No, that is not why..
- Then, no problem!

229
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,060
Let's go!

230
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,570
He left his house around 7pm, right?

231
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,070
Right.

232
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,610
Tanabata festival?
Why here?

233
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:19,550
I made a mistake.
Once more!

234
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,070
Why don't you hang up?
You break the rule..

235
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:30,060
This time, you hang up first!

236
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:33,560
Geez, this is my bedroom..
- Jun-kun, you hang up first!

237
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,650
Eh?
Nothing..

238
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:43,560
Eh, why?!

239
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,560
This is a haramaki, huh?

240
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,560
Haramaki (腹巻, literally means "bellyband") are items of Japanese clothing
that cover the stomach. They are worn for health and fashion reasons.

241
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,060
Once more!
- Okay..

242
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,080
1.. 2..

243
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,100
Why are we here again?!

244
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,140
This is weird..
- Wait a sec!

245
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,560
I can't go back to a certain time!
- Stupid, this is so stupid!

246
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,580
We were at this bus stop after
came back from that amusement park!

247
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,570
15 minutes until he left his house!

248
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,610
Come on, Shohei!
- Wait, I can't..

249
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,610
This is too difficult!
- Use your feet!

250
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:31,070
Goro-chan..
Goro-chan!

251
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,580
Oh, there he is!

252
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,550
Wait!

253
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,550
Mihane?

254
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,050
Why?

255
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,640
Too hot!

256
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,580
Don't tell me, you guys leapt through
time only to stop me from leaving?

257
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,280
Why did you leave your house?

258
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,280
I said that I don't want
to take the entrance exam.

259
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,800
They said, it means I disregard
my parent's expectation.

260
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,880
Even though you already said that you
want to be a barber since you were a kid?

261
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,310
My dad asked me to forget it,
because I am not suitable for that job.

262
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,310
Let's find out then!

263
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,300
I will support you..

264
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,300
..and your dream.

265
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,810
I'm so tired..

266
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:02,930
..being Asakura Goro who always try
keeping up with people's expectation.

267
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:06,800
Let me do what I like!

268
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,800
That is how I feel.

269
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,890
Yosh!

270
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,890
Let's do it!

271
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,800
Do what we want!

272
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,300
Stop holding back..

273
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:27,800
Now, let's do what we really want!

274
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,790
Tonight, let's express our feelings!

275
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,860
Good, it sounds good!

276
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,900
We still have a lot of chances, right?

277
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,520
Well, even if this will get us into trouble..

278
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,200
That time, Mihane-san will do something!

279
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,810
Yes, I will do anything for you.

280
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,800
How is it?

281
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,300
Well, I'm glad to hear that..

282
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,380
But you guys just came back
from an amusement park, right?

283
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:07,800
I also want to ride on a roller coaster.

284
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,800
But I would disturb you, right?

285
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:15,280
You should leave me alone.

286
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,360
We can't leave you alone,
that's why we are here.

287
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,310
Yosh, then let's start with
things that Mihane wants to do!

288
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,810
The opposite, huh?

289
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:41,940
Why? Isn't it time for Asakura
Goro to express his feelings?

290
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,850
I will think about it later, but first
let's start from things you want to do!

291
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,380
Eh?

292
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,360

293

Sorry for waiting..

305
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:48,310
Miura-san, are you okay?

306
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,310
No problem!

307
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:53,320
After I did a medical check up,
they said I was just too tired.

308
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,320
Don't force yourself, okay?

309
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:59,790
So, did you enjoy your date?

310
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:02,290
It's for the school's field trip.

311
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:04,300
Ah, I remember something!

312
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,300
I saw something strange.
- Eh?

313
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:12,300
Our students, Yoshiyama Mihane and
Fukumachi Shohei were going on a date.

314
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,800
They were...?

315
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,840
No, it's not strange at all.

316
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,290
The strange part is that they suddenly said
"Nyo~" while fell down onto the floor..

317
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:22,300
Then, without any reaction..

318
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,780
They kept eating their hamburgers.

319
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,800
Strange, isn't it?

320
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,290
They said "Nyo~", huh?
- Yes, they said so.

321
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:33,310
Somehow it looks like
they used to do it.

322
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,830
Let's cheers, thank you for today!
- Thank you for your hardwork!

323
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,860
Why don't you use a glass?
- I don't want to add up the dish pile.

324
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,810
Onee-chan said she is staying
overnight in Ojou's house.

325
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,810
*Ojou = Princess*

326
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:43,810
Eh, shouldn't she study for her exam?!

327
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:51,310
Here.

328
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,330
Here we are!
- Yosh..

329
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,300
Let's dive in!

330
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:10,290
Cool.. I always wanted to enter
a pool at night, at least for once!

331
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:12,310
Have fun like this, is the best!

332
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,830
It's nice to be boys, you can swim
although you only wear your pants!

333
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:17,380
You can join us too!
- It's okay, Mihane.. Join us!

334
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,790
No, I am a girl!

335
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:21,790
Eh? So, you're a girl?
- Yes, I am a girl!

336
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:22,940
I am a girl!

337
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,790
Get ready!

338
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,780
If I win..

339
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,820
Ready?

340
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,890
About Mihane..
- I am not going to lose!

341
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,390
Start!

342
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,300
Do your best!

343
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,810
EH?!
- Where is my pants?

344
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:58,810
Eh?

345
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,220
Shohei, you're disqualified!

346
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,660
Sorry..
- For real?!

347
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,760
I lost it, sorry..
- Where is it?

348
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,880
Hey, stop it!
You always do that!

349
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,290
Really, don't look down..
Please stop it, hey!

350
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:16,810
Altair, Vega, Deneb.

351
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:20,310
The Summer Triangle.

352
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:20,310
*The Summer Triangle is a fixture of summer skies. Its three stars are Vega, Deneb and Altair.*

353
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,810
The milkyway is so beautiful.

354
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:32,790
The starlight actually came from billion years
from the past, til it finally reach the earth now.

355
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,080
Eh? Eh? Eh?
What's happened?

356
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,800
Wait!
- 1.. 2..

357
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,300
No, wait!

358
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,890
We just set a new record!

359
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,400
This is fun!

360
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,800
Mihane, this is Shohei's idea!

361
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,820
Are you kidding me? Goro,
you're the one who suggested this!

362
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,300
Well, we just have to
turn back the time, right?

363
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,810
Next turn is Goro-chan, okay?

364
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:07,310
Have you decide
what do you want to do?

365
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,120
I want to do something bad!

366
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,800
We already entered a pool at night!

367
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:20,300
This is something that
a good kid shouldn't do.

368
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:29,300
I want to do.. something bad.

369
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:39,310
I got it.

370
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,300
Go, break all the windows!

371
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,300
We just have to turn back the time,
then everything will be fine!

372
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,800
It means nothing, right?

373
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,290
If I do this.

374
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:50,330
I know what I want to do.

375
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,330
What is it?

376
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:01,790
I want to live like this forever!

377
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,900
How about repeating this day, over and over?

378
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:14,300
It's brilliant, right?

379
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,790
It's okay if tomorrow never comes.

380
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,820
It's okay, right?

381
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,400
If no one put their expectations on me..

382
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,400
I think, I can do anything I want.

383
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,300
That's why, I wanted to do something bad.

384
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:52,310
But at the end, I don't have
any courage to do something bad.

385
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:57,800
Isn't it boring to be a good kid that
can fulfill other people's expectation?

386
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,870
You're talking about being a doctor?
- It is what my parents want.

387
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:05,810
If you don't want to do it,
I think you don't have to do it.

388
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:09,790
It is not because
I don't want to do it.

389
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,300
Sounds complicated, right?

390
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,300
Eh?
- It does.

391
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:24,290
Since I was a kid, I have always
said that I want to be a barber, right?

392
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:26,810
At first, you want to be a scissor though..

393
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,310
To be an object?

394
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,800
It was in kindergarten!
- Even so, it's weird!

395
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,820
Why did you want to be a scissor?
Didn't you sound like a pervert?

396
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,820
What a dangerous kid!
- Indeed, right?

397
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,160
But, lately..

398
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:47,380
I am not sure if being
a barber is my real dream.

399
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,300
Because I keep saying to my parents and
my friends that being a barber is my dream.

400
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:58,800
Now, I feel like I can't throw away
that dream without any responsibility.

401
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:06,350
You know Shigemi from the baseball club?

402
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:14,790
Although he has playing baseball since he was a 1st grader,
he said that he doesn't really know if he likes baseball.

403
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:14,790
*1st grader of elementary school*

404
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,810
Eh?

405
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:22,810
I really understand how he feels.

406
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,800
How he feels about...?

407
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:31,790
"I don't know whether I like it or not,
but I keep doing the best I can."

408
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:34,800
Both Shigemi and I..

409
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,800
Because we don't really have interest,
we can't be passionate about it.

410
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:48,520
In this era, being allowed to do everything
freely, only causes you lots of troubles.

411
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:56,310
Between a lot of probabilities, you have
to find out and choose your own path.

412
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,290
You sound like a stranger.

413
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:05,790
In the future, people are
given suitable roles efficiently.

414
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:12,300
In a movie?

415
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,790
I'm saying that..

416
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:20,310
Goro is a hard-working and serious person.

417
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:25,310
Most of all, he is so kind with other people.

418
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:32,330
So I think, you're suitable to be a doctor.

419
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:43,800
I think, your parents want you to become a doctor
not only because of the result of your mock exam.

420
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:49,800
But, also because they have been watching
you grow up and then, they suggest it to you.

421
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:55,790
They say, people around you could
understand you, better than you think.

422
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:58,290
Sometimes, it happens.

423
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:08,280
Argh, my miserable face has been photographed!

424
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:15,810
For me, I see it as a face of someone
who strives hard to face his own future.

425
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,810
Nice words.

426
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,800
You know..

427
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:30,790
Even when I'm in college,
I want to keep taking photos.

428
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,820
That's why, I'm planning to go to Tokyo!

429
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,320
Eh?!

430
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,300
What?

431
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,300
When did you decide it?

432
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,790
Lately.

433
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,850
But, I just told you now.

434
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,800
Somehow, I feel embarassed.

435
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:00,800
What's with that pose?

436
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:13,970
So, "tomorrow" will be "today" soon..

437
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:16,970
"Yesterday" can't last forever.

438
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:23,950
One by one, "tomorrow" becomes "today"
and then, "today" becomes "yesterday".

439
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:26,450
Then, one day we will die.

440
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:32,960
In 100 years, we won't be alive.

441
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:40,450
May I do something bad?

442
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:41,950
Eh?

443
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:45,960
Nah, I'm going to do it.

444
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,460
I really love Mihane!

445
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:02,050
I have always liked you
but I always failed to say it.

446
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,950
Then, Shohei stole you right in front of
my eyes, makes me so frustrated!

447
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:10,950
But, I also envy him!

448
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:17,450
Shohei, make sure you
can make her happy!

449
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:19,450
Do you understand?

450
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,460
I have decided.

451
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:31,470
I won't go back to 22nd century.

452
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:35,970
I am going to make her happy!

453
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:39,510
I will stake my life for her!

454
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,550
Stupid..

455
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:45,450
Thank you, Goro-chan!

456
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:48,950
Why did you thank me?!

457
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:57,440
♪～ If you see the sun through the gap between your hands.. ～♪

458
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:04,050
♪～ I can feel blood flowing inside my body. ～♪

459
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:11,980
♪～ The worms, the cricket, and even the gerridae.. ～♪

460
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:19,470
♪～ Every living things become friends! ～♪

461
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,470
Are you kidding me?!

462
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,020
Have you set the timer?
- Yes!

463
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,380
Really?

464
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,820
How many seconds?
- Six seconds.

465
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:32,980
5.. 4.. 3.. 2.. 1..

466
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:01,470
Where have you been?!

467
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:11,500
If you really want to take over
this barbershop, then do as you wish.

468
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:18,970
I quit being a barber.
- Eh?

469
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,980
I quit being a barber.

470
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:30,470
I will study for the entrance exam.

471
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,560
Then..

472
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,560
I will try to face my capability.

473
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,960
Okay..

474
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,970
You're hungry, right?

475
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:51,960
I have Natto for you!

476
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,980
OK.

477
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:08,940
Ah, I just remember..

478
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:11,950
We leapt through time..

479
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:16,450
..and I forgot about the lunch, this is bad!

480
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,060
I'm sorry..

481
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:32,720
I know you cooked all of these food with
full of efforts, but.. how should I explain this?

482
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:36,450
I totally forget..

483
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,990
This is apple-wrapped porks, right?

484
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:45,550
This is so delicious!

485
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,970
Sorry, although it may seem
like I have not ate it yet..

486
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,970
I already ate this.

487
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,470
Mom?

488
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,940
Do you know how worried I am?!

489
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:11,030
Do you hate me?
Do you want to leave me?

490
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:17,940
Don't leave me suddenly like that!

491
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,950
I won't leave.

492
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,450
I hate a hospital smell,
it gives me sickness.

493
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:43,950
How is it possible?!

494
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:49,960
To be honest, it's critical..
You have a serious condition!

495
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,030
Critical? Impossible..

496
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:57,470
Even an unhealthy lifestyle could not
cause your internal organ to be like this.

497
00:40:57,470 --> 00:41:00,450
Significantly, even your bones
have been aging too fast.

498
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:04,460
Do you remember something that caused this?

499
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,980
Remember something?

500
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:09,460
"I came from the future.."

501
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:13,520
There is no way I can say that.

502
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,380
Two buta-tama and a drink, right?

503
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,380
Buta-tama (ぶたたま, Pork Omelet) is a an Okonomiyaki (お好み焼き) a Japanese
savoury pancake containing a variety of ingredients) with some pork-toppings.

504
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,070
1900 yen.

505
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:18,460
Why did I stay in 21st century?

506
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,470
Keita, you're not allowed to taste the beer!

507
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,960
Hey, wait a sec!
Give me the money!

508
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,980
There is only one reason.

509
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:28,480
Because my family,
Yuri and Keita is here.

510
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,030
I and Yuri are not married.

511
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,950
And, Keita is not my son.

512
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:38,960
Even so, they are my family,
precious and irreplaceable.

513
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,480
What a bother!

514
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,780
You should pay 1900yen to me,
or else, I would never forgive you!

515
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,920
Because of you, he runs away!

516
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,240
Stupid!

517
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,900
Because of that fate,
I met her that day.

518
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,960
It has been 7 years, huh?

519
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,980
An encounter can change someone.

520
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:13,960
If people from the future live in this era..

521
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,460
They are going to die?

522
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:20,950
I found out about it after I had
lived for 3 years in this era.

523
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,780
So, break up with Mihane-chan
and go back to the future!

524
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,780
For the sake of you both.

525
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:28,960
Miura-san, do you still want to live here?

526
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,460
I don't mind to die, because I have a family
that is more precious than my life here.

527
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:37,960
As long as I can be with Yuri and Keita until
my very last day, I would be very happy.

528
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:50,960
But, I wonder if it's okay for me
to be the only one who feels happy.

529
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,460
Eh?

530
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:57,470
Listen..

531
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:00,470
Mihane-chan can leap through time, right?

532
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,500
Jackpot!

533
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:17,960
I have to tell you something
about Miura-san from "Ribbon".

534
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,960
Eh, what about him?

535
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,460
He would probably tell
you something weird.

536
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:27,470
But don't believe him at all,
everything he says is a lie!

537
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:29,490
Huh?

538
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:33,040
He wants us to break up.

539
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,460
Eh?

540
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:38,960
Anyway, believe me!

541
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:46,450
Whatever happens,
I "want" to stay with you.

542
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:48,470
No..

543
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:50,510
I "will".

544
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:02,950
I wonder why you skipped a class.

545
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:05,460
Turns out, you're so fired up.

546
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,460
Zoe..
- Yup?

547
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:10,460
You should go back to the 22nd century soon.

548
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:11,960
I wish I can.

549
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,530
When the time starts cleaning up itself,
it will try to erase all the unknown things.

550
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:17,070
Eh?

551
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:23,910
"Ah, I wish you wouldn't disappear.."

552
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:30,280
"..if </b>one day<b>, I could go back to that summer."

553
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:37,680
"While looking up to the blue sky.."

554
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:44,450
"I would stretch out my arms, although it </b>probably<b> means nothing."

555
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:51,010
"I don't </b>even<b> care about the destination."

556
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:55,780
"</b>Because<b> it wouldn't </b>be a place that can<b> reach the sky, right?"

557
00:44:55,780 --> 00:45:01,650
"The scent that flutters through out that summer.."

558
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:08,410
"The sunflowers that keep facing towards the sun.."

559
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:15,150
"The side of your face staring at the fireworks.."

560
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:24,580
"</b>Those things have<b> managed to cut through my heart."

561
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:36,710
"I had always thought that our future.."

562
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:40,980
"..would </b>be going to<b> continue forever."

563
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:23,910

587

..are going to be swept away by the time.

588
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:19,500
Those who came from the future like us..

589
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:25,460
Eh..

590
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,460
What do you mean?

591
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:36,470
If people from the future continue to live in this era..

592
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:38,510
They are going to die soon.

593
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:42,010
Eh?

594
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,980
Eh?

595
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:53,950
Going to die.. soon?

596
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:52,180
Eh?!

597
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:57,950
We are going to die soon?

598
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:07,550
Senpai, are you planning to stay?

599
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,520
To that day, after school..

600
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,010
Please take me back to the lab!

601
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:16,140
..with hypnotism.

602
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:19,680
So, the one who was desperately trying
to save me that day is.. Goro-chan?

603
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,410
I want to stay with you, Mihane.

604
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:22,750
You should go back to the future!

605
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:23,880
I want to you to leap through time..

606
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,520
..and make sure our family didn't exist.

607
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,420
Each encounter has its own responsibility.

608
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,760
In these 7 years, I have felt so happy.

609
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,760
I do not have a son.

610
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,760
Although this is my own decision,
am I too troublesome for you?

611
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,230
I don't want your life to be shortened.

612
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:39,730
I want to be with you forever!

613
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:41,730
Good bye.

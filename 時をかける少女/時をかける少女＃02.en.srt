1
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,300
First of all, let me state this..

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,800
This is all your fault.

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,690
Amazing~

4
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,610
We're arrived!

5
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,600
Here we are,
but it's too hot!

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,600
What an unexpected humidity!

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,620
Help me, please..

8
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:33,120
For now, don't tell anyone about us!

9
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:39,110
If you break that promise,
we will eat your brain!

10
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,100
It would be easier if
you hypnotize that kid.

11
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,120
It's hard to hypnotize a child.

12
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,120
Besides, no problem will arise because
we only stay here for three hours.

13
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,720
What a beautiful season!

14
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,620
"Summer"

15
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:12,500
Because of that day, 22nd century
doesn't have four seasons anymore.

16
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,620
There is only snow all year round.

17
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,190
People in this era won't believe it, right?

18
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,400
In our era too, summer should be there.

19
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,400
Let's bring it back, then..

20
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,110
Hey, you!

21
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,860
Your hairstyle is not cool at all!

22
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,630
Honey, do something with his hair!

23
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,630
What an uncool hairstyle!
- It's fine, it looks cool for me.

24
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,560
Wait, for godness sake!
I really hate this!

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,180
Argh, stop it!

26
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:48,640
You're going back with that hairstyle?!

27
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,100
It's terrible, the worst haircut I've ever had!

28
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,860
I think..

29
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,110
Girls who have a mushroom-like
hair are most likely submissive.

30
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:56,110
*Do-M: submissive, docile, etc.*

31
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:01,160
All the research samples we have collected
will definitely be appreciated by our Professor!

32
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,220
What's wrong?

33
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,600
I lost the drugs.

34
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,000
Huh?!

35
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,120
You lost that drug?!

36
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,000
So, we won't be able to go back?

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,460
It's not a zero possibility, though.

38
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:20,060
If we can find some chemical extracts from Crocus sylvius,
like from Lavender Essential Oil, and combine its scents..

39
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,140
What are you doing so late
in other people's house?

40
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:58,140
Is there any lab equipment in our house?

41
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,640
Mom?

42
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,140
There is no such thing in our house!

43
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,630
Shohei, if you talk to your teacher..

44
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,150
You can borrow it at school, right?

45
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,650
You're right, at school!

46
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,640
Yummy~

47
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,630
Eat it slowly..

48
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,350
Who's there?

49
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,350
Anybody there?

50
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,860
Hey..

51
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,860
This is all your fault.

52
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:38,890
So, you're saying that
we can't go back to 2122?

53
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,440
Didn't you say that we can go back?!

54
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,380
We will, let's go back..
- The hell we will!

55
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,360
Jan-ken-pon!

56
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,360
*rock-paper-scissors*

57
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,880
Once more, let me say it clearly..

58
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,880
This is all your fault.

59
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:58,370
It's better for you not to say anything
about that 'time leap' thing to anyone.

60
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,360
In this era..

61
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,860
Shohei, watch out!

62
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,360
Actually, I only intended to experience
how it feels to be in a summer season.

63
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:15,870
No, that's me. Shohei was
desperately trying to save you.

64
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,910
The moment I realized it..

65
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,410
This yukata looks good.

66
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,370
Good night.

67
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,370
Good night.

68
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,370
In this era..

69
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,380
I'm beginning to fall in love.

70
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:45,490
"Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo"
(The Girl who Leapt Through Time)

71
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,650
Episode 2

72
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,880
I remember what your dream was
when you were still in kindergarten.

73
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,380
You said, you wanted to be a scissor.

74
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,880
I thought you're a dangerous kid.

75
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,360
Eh, what was that?

76
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,930
Goro-chan, you still like me?!

77
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:27,370
Like I said, it's better if we keep being friends!

78
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,880
Mihane.
- Eh?

79
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,860
Have you ever kissed?

80
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,350
Why do you suddenly ask?

81
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,870
They say, it tastes like lemon.

82
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:44,370
Lemon-kakigori tastes good, right?

83
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:44,370
Kakigori (かき氷) is a Japanese shaved ice dessert flavored with
syrup and a sweetener, and often also with condensed milk.

84
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,870
Huh?!

85
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:50,460
Eh, where is Goro-chan?

86
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,850
Wanna try to kiss?

87
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,870
What are you talking about?

88
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,870
Friends don't do such thing!

89
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:01,370
You did it with Goro-chan, right?
- Of course, I did not!

90
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,880
Don't tell me, you're also..

91
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,400
..like me?!

92
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,970
It would trouble me!

93
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,370
It would trouble me!

94
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,870
You're troubled, huh?

95
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,380
You're the one who caused
a trouble, Yoshiyama Mihane!

96
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:27,880
Those kinds of quadratic equation
will come out in the next exam.

97
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,440
Sir, how about cubic functions?
Is it going to come out too?

98
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,360
No, not that far.

99
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,380
This time, only until these quadratic equations.

100
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,380
What would make you in trouble?
- I won't tell any of you guys.

101
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,540
Whoa, you won't tell us?
Sounds like a fishy dream..

102
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,870
Definitely!
- Fool, of course not!

103
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,890
You're vexed?
- No, I'm not!

104
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:52,960
Why bring a watermelon?
- This is my lunch!

105
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,380
The last one should do ippatsu-gag!
- Ah, no way.. Wait for me!

106
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,380
*one liner jokes*

107
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,380
You beat me..
- Wait, look..

108
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,890
Isn't it..

109
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,890
..Nishioka-kun?

110
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,460
Looks dangerous!
- Isn't it really dangerous?!

111
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,460
So dangerous!

112
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,920
Don't lean forward!

113
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:45,380
Do I look like someone
who wants to dead?!

114
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,880
Eh?

115
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:52,370
Somehow, I really like high places.

116
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:57,870
My heart will beat faster
and it makes me feel alive.

117
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,550
But, it's dangerous..

118
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,490
It's dangerous!

119
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,870
Actually, today is my death anniversary.

120
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,370
Huh?

121
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,090
You have a nice chest..

122
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,090
*she is talking about his nipples, which actually sounds.. weird?*

123
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,960
Indeed.

124
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,860
No, this is not about it.

125
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,360
On this day, two years ago,
I got a heart transplant.

126
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:31,870
Like I said, for my previous self,
today is his death anniversary.

127
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:36,410
Meanwhile, my new self is
going to start his second year.

128
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,880
This new self is obviously me,
but this is not really me.

129
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,330
Eh?

130
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,390
What do you mean?

131
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,870
My character has changed.

132
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:53,860
Although I used to be scared of high places, for
some unknown reason, I have started to like it now.

133
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:58,970
Moreover, every night after 8pm,
I feel like my heart starts beating faster.

134
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,350
But, I don't know why.

135
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:06,370
You mean, it has something to do with
someone who gave you that heart?

136
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:11,360
Who knows? I do not know
anything about my donor.

137
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,870
However, I was told once that
my donor was about 15-18 years old.

138
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:20,440
Whoever that person was,
I feel so grateful for this.

139
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,940
That's why..

140
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,860
Even for a bit, I want to live in the way
that will make this heart feels happy.

141
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,450
It's hard to believe such thing.

142
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,370
So, how could I make you believe me?

143
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,370
However, I believe that aliens are exist.

144
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,870
Aliens, huh?

145
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,880
He fell down!

146
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,370
Hey, I think..

147
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,380
I'm going to tell you guys, about my secret.

148
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,120
Ah, I don't wanna hear it..
- I can leap through time!

149
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,380
Huh?

150
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,350
She said it..

151
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:29,360
I don't how I get this power, but seems
it started after I fainted in the lab.

152
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,380
I can turn back time!

153
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,860
May I laugh?

154
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,870
Wanna try do a jan-ken?
I definitely won't lose!

155
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,870
*jan-ken-pon: rock-paper-scissor*

156
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,870
Definitely?
- Definitely!

157
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,350
"Definitely" sounds too much..
- I definitely won't lose!

158
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,850
Okay~

159
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,910
Jan-ken-pon!

160
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,960
Jan-ken-pon!

161
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,880
Wait a sec!

162
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,360
Jan-ken-pon!

163
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,870
Eh?!

164
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,370
No..

165
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,530
This is unbelievable!

166
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,370
Right?!

167
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,370
Shohei, do you believe her?

168
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:06,930
Well, I don't want to believe
in such psychic ability, though..

169
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,460
He is going to fall down in three seconds.

170
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,460
3.. 2.. 1..

171
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,870
See? See?!

172
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,780
Like I said..

173
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,440
With my power, I'm going to have an encounter!

174
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,870
You're gonna meet Nishioka-kun's donor?

175
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,920
Yup!

176
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,530
Don't you want to know what kind of
person who unbearably likes high places?

177
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:36,390
Not really.

178
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,880
I also want to know about that
mysterious thing happened at 8pm.

179
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,880
You should not do it! If somehow,
you managed to save that person's life..

180
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,870
Nishioka-kun wouldn't get his heart transplant.

181
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,940
It's absolutely bad!

182
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,360
You're gonna cause lots of trouble.

183
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,880
I don't want to change the past!

184
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,360
I just want to know.

185
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,340
Don't check on things unrelated to you!

186
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,370
Don't do it!

187
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,870
You guys are too serious!

188
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,920
If you really have such power, you can
use it for lots of other things, right?

189
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,920
He is right!

190
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,380
Would you be alright if
I ask you to be my girlfriend?

191
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:19,380
I want to be Mihane's boyfriend.

192
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,880
I like Mihane.

193
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:28,380
I already used that power,
for things that make troubled.

194
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,360
Things that make you troubled?

195
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,360
Don't check on things unrelated to you!

196
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,870
You suck!

197
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,350
I'm gonna meet her, afterall!

198
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,370
I'm so curious to know
what kind of person she is.

199
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,860
Here, take it.

200
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,410
You're gonna leap through time, huh?

201
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,910
Do it, let me see it.

202
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,860
Looking at me like that,
would make me nervous!

203
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,850
Don't look at me!
- Stupid!

204
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,380
Eh?

205
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,250
She is not here.

206
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,250
Eh..

207
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,210
Eh?!

208
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,870
Eh, really?!
Mihane!

209
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,830
Unbelievable..
This is unbelievable!

210
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,860
Shohei!

211
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,860
It's a real thing, right?

212
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,380
Eh?
Mihane!

213
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,380
I hope there won't be any problem.

214
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,350
What is this?!
This is unbelievable!

215
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,370
She is back.

216
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,860
"She is back"?
What do you mean?

217
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,820
Amazing~

218
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,860
Eh.. Mihane!

219
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,480
Are you okay?
Are you hurt somewhere?

220
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,860
Do you feel anything strange?

221
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:43,920
Whoa, it's amazing!
- Then, how was it?

222
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,950
Amazing~

223
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,870
She was not someone who liked high places.

224
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,440
Eh?

225
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,370
Amazing..
Unbelievably amazing!

226
00:15:54,860 --> 00:16:01,370
Two years ago, on the same day as yesterday,
there was a bicycle accident in the downtown.

227
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,860
She was riding down a steep road
when she suddenly had a brake failure.

228
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,360
She couldn't stop it.

229
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,380
The one who died..

230
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:23,370
..was a twelfth-grader.

231
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:23,370
Twelfth grade is typically the last year (third grade) of high school.

232
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:26,870
She is so cute!

233
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:38,870
She always studied in the library until almost
closing time, preparing for the final exams.

234
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,870
She was a diligent girl.

235
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,860
Oh, no!

236
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:01,860
Then, why Nishioka-kun likes high places now?

237
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,870
Anyway, did you really meet that person?

238
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,870
Of course, I did.

239
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:10,390
How about the mysterious thing
that happened around 8pm?

240
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,940
Who knows..

241
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:18,360
But after she went back from the library,
she always headed off to the train station.

242
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,860
Train station?

243
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,870
She was not going to meet anyone.

244
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:27,370
She always waited for the train that left at
8.20pm, and then she would head back home.

245
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,380
I see.
- Eh?

246
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,380
Do you know something?

247
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,360
You know it, right?
- Of course, I do!

248
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,380
What is it?
- She is a rail fanatic!

249
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,380
Tetsudou Otaku (鉄道オタク) is a rail fanatic, term used to define someone who is obsessed with trains.

250
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,870
Huh?!

251
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,890
Huh?

252
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,870
Because someone who
always rode on that train!

253
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,140
Like.. me?

254
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,870
No, someone she liked.

255
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,020
Oh..

256
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,440
Huh?

257
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,360
Oh~

258
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,370
Wait, I'm gonna check on it!

259
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,370
Hey!
- Mihane!

260
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:05,360
She went there as if she was going
to a nearby convenience store.

261
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,430
Is it okay to leap through time?
- No, of course it's not okay!

262
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,850
..I think.

263
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,370
It's dangerous!

264
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,370
Amazing, are you okay?

265
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,870
And, how was it?

266
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:23,880
She was in love, right?

267
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,880
Instead of being in love..

268
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:34,370
She was trying so hard
to hold back her feeling.

269
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,360
Hold back her feeling?

270
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,860
Yes.

271
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:53,870
"Avoid getting in touch with local citizens!"

272
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:56,360
Professor said that.

273
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,360
Although we hypnotized them,
it's still not good enough, I think.

274
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,940
You even come to school,
what are you planning to do?

275
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,410
People in this era..

276
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,410
..can fall in love.

277
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,380
Love?

278
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:19,380
Oh, people in the 21st century
still had a freedom to love, huh?

279
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,350
They can have a date..

280
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:25,890
..walk someone they love, to the rail station..

281
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,930
..and have a kiss.

282
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,430
Kiss?

283
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,880
Pressing someone's lips to another?

284
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,390
Some people even do
more than just pressing it.

285
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:43,370
I see, you know the details..

286
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,370
Because I have learnt about it.

287
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,450
Eh?!

288
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:53,370
Senpai, do you want to fall in love?

289
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:53,370
Senpai (先輩) is an upperclassman, someone of a higher age, or senior.

290
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,370
No way..

291
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:03,370
Love has no benefit
and the risk is too high.

292
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,400
98% of people in 22nd century..

293
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,350
..are married based on their genetic traits.

294
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,890
Of course, including me.

295
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:19,860
Before the drug can be re-created,
we can't go back to the 22nd century.

296
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:24,370
Since we are now living in 2016..

297
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,870
How about trying to enjoy it, Zoe?

298
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:40,970
You spread such thing on the net?
- Yes, everyone does it too.

299
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,090
Good morning!

300
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:46,190
Shohei, look at this!

301
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,560
Spiderman's kiss?

302
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,560
*term used for an upside-down kiss in which one person kisses the other in an upside-down position*

303
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,740
Yes!

304
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,680
Pretty sure you're gonna regret it!

305
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,680
This will stay on the net forever!
- That is why I uploaded it.

306
00:20:54,680 --> 00:21:01,190
My boyfriend is so romantic, he said things like
Nagashima-san, "With this, our love will stay forever!"

307
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,930
How romantic!
- Right?

308
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:07,730
But, who is Nagashima-san?

309
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,760
Each of them looks good.

310
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,680
It looks good, right?

311
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,190
These photos are good?

312
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,190
Such photos...?!

313
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,180
She was not someone who liked high places.

314
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,170
Sorry, I found out about her.

315
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:56,180
About my donor?

316
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,700
Yes.

317
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,700
Tell me, what kind of person she was?

318
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:08,200
She was a diligent girl.

319
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:19,230
"I want to be with Sensei, but
I have to wait until graduation."

320
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:19,230
Ryou-omoi (両思い) is the opposite of Kata-omoi (片思い, means unrequited
love), which indicates that she was wishing to be his teacher's girlfriend.

321
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,680
She was in love with someone
she shouldn't fall in love with.

322
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,210
You may not believe me, but..

323
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,690
..that's the truth.

324
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,710
I see.

325
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:52,200
So, that's what happened around 8pm.

326
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,790
Thank you.
- Ah, it's nothing..

327
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:59,600
On the contrary, I checked
on things unrelated to me.

328
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,190
No, it's okay.

329
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:04,710
Each night, my heart beats faster around 8pm.

330
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:09,210
It must be because, she was used
to hold back her own feelings, right?

331
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:17,190
Afterall, we have to do
what we want while we can.

332
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:25,200
But suddenly taking her to high places,
would only make her feel troubled, right?

333
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,700
She might want to say, "No, this is not
the kind of heart-beat that I want!"

334
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:38,740
I can't tell everything about
that girl, to Nishioka-kun.

335
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,210
Eh?

336
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:50,710
She waited for Yano-sensei?!

337
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,180
No one knows..

338
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:58,200
..about Yano-sensei before
he came to teach in this school.

339
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,770
I think, I tend to intervene
with somebody else's problem.

340
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:07,680
Make sure you remember things
you have to do before 3pm!

341
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,200
Hey, are you awake?

342
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:19,180
If you really want to go to public university,
you have to be more focused on your study.

343
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:26,180
Sensei, did you ever fall
in love with your student?

344
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:31,180
Why do you ask suddenly? I never did.
If I did, there would be a trouble, right?

345
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:36,690
But there was a student who liked you, right?

346
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:38,690
So, what?

347
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:46,200
What are you thinking about that girl?

348
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,700
No student ever like me, though.

349
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,670
Even in your previous school..

350
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:57,170
None of the students loved you?

351
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,180
If it's just a misunderstanding..

352
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,200
There was.

353
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,700
..I think.

354
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:16,690
It's not a misunderstanding!

355
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:20,700
At the end, I don't know what it was
 and I can never find out what it was.

356
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,200
Don't spead any weird gossip, okay?

357
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:35,700
She was died before she could
convey her true feeling. It's tragic..

358
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,180
So tragic!

359
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,190
Because no one knows
when they will die, right?

360
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:44,190
Moreover, her feeling has been
considered as a misunderstanding.

361
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:48,780
I'm so vexed!
- Why are you so vexed?

362
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:52,200
Although it felt so painful,
she kept holding back her feeling.

363
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:57,200
Then suddenly, everything had come to its end.
You don't know how frustrating it feels!

364
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,190
I know that feeling!

365
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:07,730
You're talking about how it felt when your
waist hurt and you have to leave the boat club.

366
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:11,700
Both your efforts and dreams became nothing.

367
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,700
Nothing at all.

368
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:23,180
That girl's love is also considered as nothing.

369
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,210
Although it really did exist.

370
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,770
Mihane..

371
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:31,700
Although you can leap through time..

372
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,690
You are not allowed to
change that girl's fate, okay?

373
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:40,690
Or else, you would snatch out Nishioka-kun's life.

374
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,730
I understand.

375
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:01,200
Anyway, Goro..
- Hm?

376
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,700
You like Mihane, right?

377
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,960
Eh?!

378
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,800
Actually, I think I'm also
falling in love with Mihane.

379
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,700
I wonder if it's alright for two
people, to love the same person.

380
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,200
What's with that question?

381
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,190
This is my first love,
so I don't really get it.

382
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:30,690
If it's alright, then we're good.

383
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,210
For the rest..

384
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:37,210
We should just leave it to Mihane.

385
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:41,190
Let her decide, right?

386
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,690
See ya!

387
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,200
Goro..

388
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,720
Have you ever kissed?

389
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,290
Huh?!

390
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:02,690
I wonder if Mihane has ever kissed.

391
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,700
I don't know!

392
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,180
So, it means..

393
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:11,700
Gora and Mihane..

394
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,170
..have never kissed yet.

395
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:17,220
Yosh!

396
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,260
Yosh~
- Yosh?

397
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,180
Yosh! Yosh! Yosh!

398
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,680
What the heck does he mean?!

399
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,960
Bye~ Bye~ Bee~

400
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,960
Bye~ Bye~ Bee~

401
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:44,370
I don't say anything!
Please don't eat my brain!

402
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:46,420
I won't eat your brain.

403
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,420
In exchange for that..

404
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:54,360
Please give me some food!

405
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,370
I'm back!
- Welcome back!

406
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,870
Mii-kun..
- Hm?

407
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:04,390
I have a friend who looks hungry.

408
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:07,390
May I give her a Buta-tama?

409
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:07,390
Buta-tama (ぶたたま, Pork Omelet) is a an Okonomiyaki (お好み焼き) a Japanese
savoury pancake containing a variety of ingredients) with some pork-toppings.

410
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:12,880
For your friend?
Of course, you may.

411
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,380
Why don't you invite her to come here?

412
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:20,370
Don't you have a house or a family?

413
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:24,880
They are so far,
and I can't go home.

414
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,930
But you have a friend, right?
- Oh, you're talking about Senpai?

415
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,970
He pisses me off!

416
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,970
You have a fight?
- Something like that.

417
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:41,370
What do you call this?
Buta-tama? This is the best!

418
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:49,870
Because Mii-kun made it!
- Mii-kun? Who is that?

419
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:53,370
He is not my real dad,
but he is my dad.

420
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:00,510
I see.

421
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:03,370
Here comes the weakness!

422
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,890
This is impossible, right?!

423
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,800
"Chapter 7"

424
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,430
"With a kiss, make her fall (in love)!"

425
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:17,380
This sounds bad, really!

426
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,880
Welcome home!
- Ah, I'm home..

427
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:26,370
Here it is.

428
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:32,410
Taco-rice!

429
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:32,410
Taco rice (タコライス takoraisu?) is a popular of Okinawan cuisine, consists of taco-flavored ground
beef served on a bed of rice, frequently served with shredded cheese, lettuce, tomato and salsa.

430
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:35,910
Somehow, feels strange.

431
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,370
I forgot how much I love cooking.

432
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:44,890
Although he can't eat it right now..

433
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:48,390
Having you eat this dish
is also a happiness for me.

434
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,380
Mom, are you in love with me?

435
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,420
Yes, I love you so much.

436
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:59,890
Well then, may I kiss you?

437
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:04,390
What a joke, people will laugh
at you if you're such a mother-con!

438
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:04,390
Mother-con or "maza-con" is a Japanized English for "mother complex" (mama's boy).

439
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:06,380
Sorry, I just want to try it.

440
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:09,380
So cruel, try it with your hand!

441
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:39,410
"I wonder if it's alright for two
people, to love the same person."

442
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:42,980
It's not alright!

443
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,370
Heck~

444
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:49,390
I bring some university
brochures for you. Here!

445
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:51,840
No, thank you. I have much time left.
- Soon you have to decide!

446
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,380
Yes, but now I have to do my homework.

447
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:58,370
If you're hungry, we still have
natto for you. Do you best!

448
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:58,370
Nattō (納豆) is a traditional Japanese food made from soybeans fermented with
Bacillus subtilis var. natto. It has powerful smell, strong flavor, and slimy texture.

449
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:00,370
Okay~

450
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,880
Jun-kun, you hang up first!

451
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,370
Eh? Then, I'll hang up first.

452
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:19,370
Let me countdown, ready?

453
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:22,370
1.. 2..

454
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:24,890
Why don't you hang up?
You break the rule..

455
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:26,320
This time, I'll hang up.

456
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,440
Here I go.

457
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,860
1.. 2..

458
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:33,380
What the hell are you doing?!
- Who is that Jun-kun?

459
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,890
My boyfriend.
- Eh, you have a boyfriend?

460
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:41,390
Of course, I have.
I'm already an eight-grader!

461
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:41,390
Eighth grade is typically the second year (second grade) of junior high.

462
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:46,390
What have you done?
- Stop asking like children!

463
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,150
You know, Naho..

464
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:58,380
In this world, although they are deeply falling in love,
there are people who should hold back their feelings.

465
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,690
So, what?

466
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,880
Then you shouldn't fall in love, Onee-chan!

467
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,870
Nowadays, men are so submissive!

468
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,320
Why?

469
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,130
Let's stop drinking alcohol for now, okay?

470
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:20,860
I wonder if Yano-sensei is not interested
in having relationship with any woman.

471
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,340
Mii-kun, are you alright?
- Yes, I'm alright.

472
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,870
Mii-kun, are you alright?
- Yes, just having a nosebleed.

473
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,400
It's fine, this is not a problem.

474
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,060
Don't make me shocked!

475
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:39,900
Yano-sensei has a high-level defense!

476
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:39,900
*she literally says "guard" instead of "defense", though*

477
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,400
What are those?

478
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,630
Utility poles and telephone wires.

479
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,980
Why?
- Eh?

480
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,900
It somehow looks beautiful.

481
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,400
Sometimes, we have that feeling
(when we look at things), right?

482
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,900
Well, indeed. But..

483
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:06,890
Somehow, it seems like you didn't really want
to take those photos when you took them.

484
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,880
Ah, sorry..

485
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:19,890
I don't know which one will look good.

486
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:21,890
There is nothing I want to take photo of.

487
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:26,390
It shouldn't just a "thing", right?

488
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,430
How about taking the moment?

489
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:32,400
The moment?

490
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:32,400
*he literally says "time" instead of "moment", though*

491
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,890
What kind of moments do you
want to keep forever, Mihane?

492
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:39,390
I want to to see those moments.

493
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,450
Sorry for being so inconsiderate.

494
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:48,380
It's okay.

495
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:52,890
However.. photos are good, right?

496
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:56,890
It can capture a moment forever.

497
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,400
That's it!
- Eh?

498
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:16,380
That girl's love might be able..

499
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,380
..to be conveyed through a photo.

500
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:31,430
I'm from The East High
School's Photography Club.

501
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,700
I'm looking for a model..

502
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,620
Sorry, I'm busy.

503
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,620
Asking her out of nowhere
would obviously look suspicious.

504
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:46,130
Excuse me..
- Do you hate being photographed?

505
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:47,630
Hey..

506
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,140
Being a model is impossible for me.

507
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,140
There is an insect there, look!

508
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,160
I really need to find a model.

509
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,110
Eh, really?

510
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,640
Sorry to bother you,
although I know you're busy.

511
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,640
I'm looking for a model, and
then I see you who look so cute..

512
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,130
Please, be a model for me!

513
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:19,660
What's wrong with you?
Somebody, help me!

514
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,700
I'm not a suspicious person.

515
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,700
I really am not!

516
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,130
What makes you look so troubled?

517
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:37,630
Ah, I have been looking for a model.

518
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:41,620
No matter how many times
I asked, I always got rejected.

519
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:44,650
Looks tiring..
- Yes~

520
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:46,690
Is there anything I can do to help you?

521
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:47,930
Eh?

522
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,260
Oh..

523
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,630
Yes, please!

524
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:53,130
I will take the photo, so..

525
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:55,130
Could you be the model?

526
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,120
Are you going to use it for a competition?

527
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,620
Probably..

528
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:04,640
If you lose, don't blame it on me.

529
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,190
Okay!

530
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:09,690
Finally~

531
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:20,620
I want to take prove of your love.

532
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:23,110
Do I look good?

533
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,610
This is my first time
being a model.

534
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:32,190
Hmm, can you please open it?

535
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:32,190
*she literally asks that girl to take off, or to (let her heart) be naked*

536
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,220
Eh?!

537
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,720
Open your heart!

538
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,640
What do you mean?

539
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,140
Like.. if you want to fall in love,
don't resist to show your feelings.

540
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,630
Imagine as if I am the one you love.

541
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:51,130
Let out those feelings of love!

542
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,610
I like you..

543
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:07,140
I like you.

544
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,620
I like you.

545
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,640
I like you!

546
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,640
I like you!

547
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,680
The prove of her love..

548
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,620
..is not something that I can ask.

549
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:25,120
How is it?
Looks good?

550
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,140
It does look good.

551
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:35,630
I hate being suck at this.

552
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:40,130
Sorry, I can't take it properly.

553
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:47,130
How could you know that I have
been holding back my feelings?

554
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:50,110
Because your heart shows it.

555
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:53,110
So, a cameraman can understand such thing?

556
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,620
Interesting!

557
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,610
Don't you want to convey your feeling?

558
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:13,160
He is a teacher.

559
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,160
The one I like.

560
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,680
If I can get accepted in the faculty
of medicine, I'm going to confess!

561
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,110
Today is her last day.

562
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:38,620
I should learn maths!

563
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:43,110
Next time, tell me about your love story.

564
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:45,610
I am not allowed to change her fate.

565
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:49,150
Eh?

566
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:58,120
Why are you crying?

567
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:05,130
You're so weird!

568
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:09,130
You shouldn't cry that much while saying goodbye.
You know that this is not a forever farewell, right?

569
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:13,210
Hey, stop crying!

570
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,130
Because you're so cute,
you should laugh instead.

571
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:20,610
I can't wait to see those photos!

572
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,630
Although you can leap through time..

573
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:27,630
You are not allowed to
change that girl's fate, okay?

574
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:38,150
Even for a bit, I want to live in the way
that will make this heart feels happy.

575
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,620
Come on!

576
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,620
See you later.

577
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:14,170
Without telling her that she has
a brake failure, I watch her leaving.

578
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:29,940
"Ah, I wish you wouldn't disappear.."

579
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:36,930
"..if </b>one day<b>, I could go back to that summer."

580
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:43,930
"While looking up to the blue sky.."

581
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:50,630
"I would stretch out my arms, although it </b>probably<b> means nothing."

582
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:57,100
"I don't </b>even<b> care about the destination."

583
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:01,900
"</b>Because<b> it wouldn't </b>be a place that can<b> reach the sky, right?"

584
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:07,830
"The scent that flutters through out that summer.."

585
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:14,400
"The sunflowers that keep facing towards the sun.."

586
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:21,360
"The side of your face staring at the fireworks.."

587
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:32,800
"</b>Those things have<b> managed to cut through my heart."

588
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:42,750
"I had always thought that our future.."

589
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:47,630
"..would </b>be going to<b> continue forever."

590
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:53,900
"I wonder if this sadness would also disappear </b>someday<b>."

591
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:59,630
"Just like the summer we had spent together.."

592
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:03,750
"..when it finally came to its end."

593
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:10,760
"Ah, I wish you wouldn't disappear.."

594
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:17,750
"..if </b>one day<b>, I could go back to that summer."

630
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,580
Yano-sensei?

631
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,300
Oh, Maekawa-sensei..

632
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:43,120
I got these free tickets..

633
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,810
Would you want to go together?

634
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:46,060
"Barber"?

635
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:46,990
It looks interesting.

636
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:50,990
Yes, if you wouldn't mind..

637
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,490
Let's watch it together!

638
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:56,720
Looks good..

639
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:58,960
Really?

640
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:02,320
I like that one.

641
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:09,630
It looks nice.

642
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,220
Those are good photos, right?

643
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,610
You're right.

644
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:24,110
But, I really like this one.

645
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:28,130
I wish I could take a better photo.

646
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:33,630
Turns out, people can start falling in
love in such a very short time.

647
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:40,630
Although she only had a short life,
that girl was able to fall in love.

648
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:43,130
Love is probably good, right?

649
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,760
Oh, no!

650
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,000
I'll catch that one!

651
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:54,890
It starts drowning..

652
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,210
You can reach it!

653
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:00,130
A little further!

654
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,700
What are you doing?

655
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:18,700
"With a kiss, make her fall (in love)!"

656
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:23,120
Although I think,
this is not what it means.

657
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:29,210
We will give the original novel "The Girl Who Leapt Through Time" for 30 lucky people!

658
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:31,370
Check our homepage for the details!

659
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:32,920
Everyone, don't forget to participate!

660
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,560
Both of you wanna leap through time?

661
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,450
Yes!

662
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:38,500
Let's make a recital!

663
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,700
Transfer student?
No one told me about this.

664
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,120
You are not allowed fall in love
with someone from a different era!

665
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,400
You just have to do it.

666
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,840
The power of love will help you!

667
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,680
Please be my Juliet!

668
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,650
No matter how,
I want to be Romeo.

669
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:55,950
There are only three ingredients left!

670
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:57,450
Sorry for being such a bother.

671
00:45:57,450 --> 00:45:59,450
Let's go!

672
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:01,320
See?

673
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,320
Let's do our best!

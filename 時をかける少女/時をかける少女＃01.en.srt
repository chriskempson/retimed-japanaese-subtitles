1
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,730
Summer...?

2
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,730
I really hate it.

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,710
I was kinda like it back then, but..

4
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,220
Since I was in junior high,
I started to dislike it.

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,720
Being sweaty is so troublesome, right?

6
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,740
I'd rather wanna go to school naked.

7
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,740
Cool!
- We arrived!

8
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,260
Eh, being naked is a bad idea..

9
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,800
Because it would be hard
to cover all those body hair.

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,720
The hair on the arm, armpit, back, etc.

11
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,720
Anyway, why do those hair exist?

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,720
Only to make you worry
if it seen by others?

13
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,730
Flying in the sky or reading people's mind..

14
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:58,800
I don't believe such psychic ability exists.

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,240
But, if it does exist..

16
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,240
I want to have an ability to remove
all unwanted hair in an instant!

17
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,750
That's dangerous!

18
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,230
Unbelievable..

19
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,370
Sounds fool, huh?

20
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:19,320
But compared with spoon-bending,
it will definitely be more useful!

21
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,740
What is this?

22
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,220
Probably, a giant Oarfish?

23
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,220
Giant Oarfish is the largest, greatly elongated, pelagic lampriform bony fish
that is usually found in all temperate to tropical oceans yet rarely seen.

24
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,230
Without realizing it,
I am now a twelfth-grader.

25
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,230
Twelfth grade is typically the last year (third grade) of high school.

26
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,250
I feel so old.

27
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:45,220
Friends, parents, teachers..
Everyone talk about exams. I got it!

28
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,720
I will study, but now I have to
do something else which is..

29
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,220
..nothing!

30
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:55,240
Eh~ this is so boring, although this is
my last summer in high school.

31
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,210
You lost that drug?

32
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,230
So, we won't be able to go back?

33
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,770
It's not a zero possibility though, wait a sec..

34
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,840
Unbelievable!

35
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,840
Yosh, I decided to enjoy this year's
summer season to the fullest!

36
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,240
Eh...? It's so quiet,
I thought you left me.

37
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,990
Where did you go?

38
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:23,490
Don't just leave and
disappear on me like that!

39
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,510
So cruel..

40
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,060
What are you doing so late
in other people's house?

41
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:43,980
Hey, where are you actually?

42
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,480
Please, don't go too far..

43
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,000
I feel lonely and it hurts, stop.. wait!

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,550
We will meet again, right?

45
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,490
No, this is scary. Please..

46
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,490
Come back!

47
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:02,990
Who's there?
Anybody there?

48
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,470
What is..

49
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,480
..this scent?

50
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:39,500
"Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo"
(The Girl who Leapt Through Time)

51
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,470
I'm more suited to go to
barbershop than hair saloon.

52
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,980
I can't help but liking a shaver.

53
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,460
Even girls can have beards, you know..

54
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,960
Like a lanugo.

55
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,960
Lanugo is very fine, soft, usually unpigmented, downy hair produced by the fetal hair follicles that is sometimes found on the body of a fetus or newborn baby.

56
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,570
You don't need to check it.

57
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,480
Eh, what was that?!

58
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,980
Don't tell me, Goro-chan..

59
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,980
You like me?

60
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,470
Even like this?!

61
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,560
Unbelievable..
This is impossible!

62
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,980
Ouch..

63
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,470
What's with this haircut?

64
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,970
You cut it in a hair saloon
yesterday, didn't you?

65
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,490
Altough I already told you
not to cut it that way.

66
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,040
This doesn't suit me!

67
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,250
"Today is July 7th, the day of Tanabata Festival."

68
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,730
"Everyone, please do write your wish on Tanzaku."

69
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,730
Tanzaku (短冊) are small pieces of colored paper used for hanging wish.

70
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,750
I can't go to school with such hair..

71
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,740
Why? It looks cute, like a helmet.

72
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,740
Helmet-like hairstyle is so lame!

73
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,300
"A Giant Oarfish was found in
Fujiura Coast, Shizuoka Prefecture."

74
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,250
Fujiura is close from here, right?

75
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,720
Isn't she from the same school as you, Mihane?

76
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,220
Wow, she is in a nationwide-broadcast news!

77
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,740
Thanks for the meal.

78
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,780
I'm leaving now.
- Take care!

79
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,320
The ice cream in the fridge is mine.

80
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,320
If you eat that ice, you will get
pricked by thousands of needles!

81
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,740
Mihane, get ready quickly
or else, you'll be late for school.

82
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,720
I'm going to take a day off.

83
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,730
Eh, really?!

84
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,230
Even though you always have a perfect
attendance since you're in kindegarten?

85
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,720
This would feel like getting choked all
day despite having a healthy body.

86
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,320
Bon appetit!

87
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,220
Mom, where is my camera?

88
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,220
Eh, I don't know..

89
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,730
Where is it?

90
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,230
Here it is!

91
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,220
Let's go!

92
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,220
Good morning!
- Good morning!

93
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,210
Good morning!
- Good morning!

94
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,710
Hey..

95
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,730
Your hairstyle looks nice!

96
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,220
It suits you!
- Thank you for the lie.

97
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:28,790
No, it's true! But my dad will be sad, the moment he knows that you won't cut your hair in our barbershop anymore.

98
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,230
Nah, I'm disappointed with that hair saloon.

99
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,710
I will come again to Asakura Barbershop!

100
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,210
Really? Let's go!

101
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,240
Head off without me.
- Eh...?

102
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,720
I need to be filled with
my gasoline first!

103
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,720
Gasoline?

104
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,730
Is it for me?

105
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:53,230
*He asked if Mihane chose that mushroom-like haircut
because he'd once said to her that he likes mushroom.*

106
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:53,230
Because I said that I like mushroom?

107
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,720
Of course not..

108
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,720
Mihane, your gasoline is..

109
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,240
Today, I'm filled with a high-octane one!

110
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,240
High-octane? What is that?
What is high-octane?

111
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,230
5 minutes left.
- 5 minutes left?

112
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,750
Hey, do you like a man like him?

113
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,810
Yes, I like such good-looking man!

114
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,720
Like him?
- Yup!

115
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,730
Goro-chan..

116
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:39,250
Goro-chan, what are you doing?

117
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,740
Ah, sorry..

118
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,270
Sorry.. See you after class!
- I made you drop these flowers.

119
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:51,330
Please do forgive her,
I will scold her properly later.

120
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,740
Sorry..
- Sorry.

121
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,250
Let's go!

122
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,210
What's happened?

123
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,230
I bumped into him.

124
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,240
I bumped into him because
I was busy calling you, Goro-chan!

125
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,720
Isn't it weird?
How does it look like?

126
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,720
It looks round, like a mushroom.

127
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,730
Hello, good morning!
- Good morning..

128
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,230
Your haistyle looks nice!
It really suits you.

129
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,220
You cut it, right?
It does suit you!

130
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,240
Yup, good morning!

131
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,740
Good morning..
- Don't laugh at me!

132
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,240
Good morning..
- Oh, you cut your hair?

133
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,800
Like a Kokeshi, somehow..

134
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,720
Kokeshi are Japanese dolls made from wood, have a simple trunk and
an enlarged head with a few thin, painted lines to define the face.

135
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,720
Kokeshi, huh?!

136
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,740
As expected from Shohei,
you're as funny as ever!

137
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,240
I knew, Shohei would definitely make fun of me!

138
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,740
Is it too much?

139
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,760
To solve this problem..

140
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,240
We just have to multiply the reciprocal
difference between these denominators.

141
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,720
The difference between 3 and 1 is 2,
so we should multiply this with 1/2.

142
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,730
Which means, the main point is
to break apart the partial-fraction!

143
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,230
Easy, right?

144
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,710
Well then, for the next similar problem..

145
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:06,710
Who is going to solve this?

146
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,230
Yoshiyama Mihane!

147
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:36,210
Swimsuit looks nice, but now
it's time for math, okay?

148
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,210
Where is your textbook?

149
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,240
At least you bring a notebook, right?

150
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,800
I don't bring anything but this..

151
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,720
Wow, so romantic!

152
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,720
What a fool!
What do you come to school for?

153
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,220
Sorry..

154
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:12,280
Yoshiyama Mihane.
- Uh, oh.. yes?

155
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,720
What's with that dying message?

156
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,240
It means that.. this problem
can not be solved, I think.

157
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,750
But, I read it as "I want a special extra lesson".

158
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,250
No, thank you..

159
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:36,220
I already told him seriously
that I want to break up.

160
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,740
But somehow, we ended up kissing.

161
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,730
Eh, why did you end up kissing?

162
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,730
Since then, it was still two and a half
before the the cram school began.

163
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,720
Our lips became so swollen..

164
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,220
You're such an adult, Eri-chin!

165
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,270
I also want to have a boyfriend.

166
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:55,270
I don't want a princess
like you to have a boyfriend!

167
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,250
How about you, Mihane?

168
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,720
This year too, you will go to Tanabata
Festival with Asakura and Shohei?

169
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,240
Seems so.

170
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,220
Since we do it every year.

171
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,260
Asakura-kun will wear Yukata?

172
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,290
I want to be hugged by him!

173
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,730
Like this, tightly.

174
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,730
So cool..

175
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,990
I wonder why every high school
girls love to talk about love.

176
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,490
I hate that topic.

177
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:27,220
Didn't you say that there's a cool college student
who works at a convenience store nearby?

178
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,760
No, it was..

179
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,800
..not love or such thing.

180
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,850
More like a gasoline?
- Really?

181
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:35,230
It's not love!

182
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,740
Congrats, give applause to Yoshiyama!

183
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,240
It's broken in pieces..

184
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,730
I'm so sorry!

185
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,220
Somehow, I have a bad luck today.

186
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,740
I'm shocked!

187
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,740
I'm gonna throw this garbage.
- Okay.

188
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,730
Put the chairs down.
- Roger!

189
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,230
Please show us a little dance!

190
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,230
How cute!

191
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,240
Take a photo!

192
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,740
Ok, one.. two..

193
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,250
Who's there?

194
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,730
Anybody there?

195
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,220
What is this scent?

196
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,740
There is no such assertive man in life, huh?

197
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,730
How about Yano-sensei?

198
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,730
Yano-sensei?
His voice is too loud.

199
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,250
He wears fashionable clothes
and looks easily get bored.

200
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,800
This is a secret, ok?
- Okay..

201
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,220
How are you feeling? Both of them
are so worried, waiting for you.

202
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,230
So worried? Even though you're
both busy talking about love.

203
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,230
Why were you taking a nap in the lab?

204
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,720
I  wasn't taking a nap!

205
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,240
I smelt a sweet scent from fluid
that came out of a ruptured tube.

206
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,260
I was so curious so I smelt it again
and then I started feeling dizzy.

207
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,810
Was there a ruptured tube?

208
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,730
There wasn't.
- Eh?!

209
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,750
We just found you unconscious.

210
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,230
Eh, there was no flask or beak?

211
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,720
Those tubes were shattered everywhere, right?

212
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,240
Looks like someone had some
kind of experiments there..

213
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,240
I made him drop those tubes..
- I said, no such thing!

214
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,240
Right, Shohei?
- Eh...?

215
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,290
Right, nothing at all.

216
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,810
You heard him?
- Eh...?!

217
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,730
But Mihane, are you okay?

218
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,730
Do you feel anything strange in your body?

219
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,230
What's wrong?

220
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,230
What is it?

221
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,230
I'm hungry..

222
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,240
Are you kidding?!

223
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,240
You're the worst!
- Let's go home!

224
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:40,730
The conclusion is you had an anemia and felt
so hungry that it made you start hallucinating.

225
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,210
These two are so cruel!

226
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:47,820
Since there will be final exams soon, they asked me if there is
something wrong with my brain and told me to see a doctor.

227
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:52,220
You will face the final exams soon? Feels like
you just started being high schoolers yesterday.

228
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,240
Time flies so fast, right?
Our Keita is already a third-grader.

229
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,750
Right?

230
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,230
I should fill in my career plan.

231
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,730
What should I write?

232
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,220
Goro-chan, you're going to work in
your dad's barbershop, right?

233
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,270
But, my parents want me to go to university.

234
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,840
You should pursue your own
dream, because this is your life.

235
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,230
Although he is in social science,
he passed the science exams!

236
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:16,730
Then be a doctor, working with scalpel
gives you more profit than with scissors!

237
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:19,220
Hey..
- That's a different issue, though.

238
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,740
Eh, did we ever heard
about Shohei's career plan?

239
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,240
We haven't heard it.

240
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,260
Researcher, in pharmaceutical fields.

241
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,330
So you have such dream, huh?

242
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:35,220
Not a dream, it's the only thing
that can fit my genetic traits.

243
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,220
The only thing that can fit
your genetic traits? So absurd..

244
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,220
What was that?
- So cool..

245
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,220
Then, what kind of job
fits Mihane's genetic traits?

246
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,240
Eh.. what?

247
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:50,750
A boy and a girl that suddenly appeared on this boat?

248
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,800
You must be kidding, Yoshiko-chan..

249
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,220
It's true, that was just yesterday!

250
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,720
How can't you remember it?

251
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,720
Do you still take photos with your camera?

252
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,730
Yes, but I don't know what
kind of photos I should take.

253
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:06,230
Those photos taken by my friends using their
smartphones, looks more fashionable than mine.

254
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:11,230
I don't have the talent.
Then, I start disliking it.

255
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,710
Do you know her?
She is from our school.

256
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,720
Onishi Atsumi, right?
She is an internet idol.

257
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,720
Because of this, netizens are getting hyped up.

258
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,220
What do they say?

259
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,740
"Sent by a Dragon God, The Miracle Idol"

260
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,740
According to Japanese mythology, the Oarfish is
a messenger from the Dragon God of The Sea.

261
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,290
She just found an Oarfish
that came near the coast, right?

262
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,730
Nowadays, being an idol needs a foreword story.

263
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:42,230
Like flipping a hand, everyone in Class-2 seems
trying so desperately to be close with her.

264
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,730
Because now, she becomes a celebrity.

265
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,720
I also want to be a celebrity.

266
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,800
If it was back then when you were cute,
I think it's possible for you to be an idol.

267
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:01,740
But in this era, only having a cute face
won't ever be enough to be an idol.

268
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,720
Thank you for you hardwork!
- Thank you for your hardwork!

269
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,240
Then.. Mihane was born in the wrong era, right?

270
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,240
Wrong era?

271
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,290
I'm home!

272
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,710
Welcome back!

273
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,220
Don't eat my brain!

274
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,220
Eh, what's wrong with Keita?

275
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,220
Who knows..

276
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,730
Jan-ken-pon!

277
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,730
*rock-paper-scissors*

278
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,730
Yosh, PINEAPPLE~

279
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,730
Each time you win a rock-paper-scissors, you should spell a six-syllable word in exchange
for six steps down. This time, the word is パイナップル or "Pa-i-na-tsu-pu-ru" (Painapuru).

280
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,740
I wonder if this year will be the last time
we could go to the festival together.

281
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,240
Why?

282
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,220
Because next year, not all of us
will stay in this town, right?

283
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,730
Ah, right..

284
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:49,800
The 'princess' said that she want to be hugged by Asakura-kun in Yukata.

285
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,720
Maybe you should go with her..

286
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,240
Jan-ken-pon!

287
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,740
Yosh!

288
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,240
CHOCOLATE~

289
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,240
This time, the word is チョコレート or "Chi-yo-ko-re-i-to" (Chokoreeto).

290
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,730
Maybe I should..

291
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,790
If I go with Mihane, I will be forced
to eat the octopus from Takoyaki.

292
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,790
Takoyaki (蛸焼) is a ball-shaped Japanese snack made of a wheat flour-based
batter and cooked in a special moulded pan, typically filled with octopus.

293
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,500
It troubles me every year.

294
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,840
This year, I won't eat Takoyaki.

295
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,230
Jan-ken-pon!

296
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,730
Yes!

297
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:23,730
PINEAPPLE~

298
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:23,730
This time, the word is パイナップル or "Pa-i-na-tsu-pu-ru" (Painapuru).

299
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,220
This is so vexing!

300
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,230
You never win even once,
by the theory, it's too strange.

301
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,250
I did it seriously, though..

302
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:40,750
Mihane, thanks for the juice!
- Let's have a drink!

303
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,240
Heck~

304
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,780
Yuu-kun, thanks for waiting!

305
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,310
Here.

306
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,240
That gasoline has a girlfriend, huh?

307
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,240
Moreover, she has a long hair?!

308
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,710
Argh, so vexing..

309
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:12,250
It pisses me off!

310
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,250
Ah, my back feels itchy.
Scratch it for me!

311
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,720
Mihane..

312
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,740
..lacks of delicacy, right?

313
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,710
Because it's Goro-chan..

314
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,230
Be more feminine!

315
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,730
If you say it that way,
I'm gonna beat you up!

316
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,790
Well, then..

317
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,210
Bye~ Bye~ Bee~

318
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:19,720
Everything looks the same as usual.

319
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,240
What should I take photos of?

320
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,810
That doesn't seem right..

321
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,240
Yes, good.
Put it here..

322
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:55,340
Eh, a turtle?

323
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,720
Why is this turtle here?

324
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:10,230
It's dangerous!

325
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,230
Watch out!

326
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,720
Seems I really have a bad luck today..

327
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,720
I'm going to die!

328
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:27,220
Eh?

329
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,760
Watch out!

330
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,250
Eh, why?!

331
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:43,720
I already died, right?!

332
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,720
By any chance, I'm a ghost?!

333
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,220
Grandma, can you see me?

334
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:56,230
Is it finally my turn
to go to the afterlife?

335
00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:00,220
So, I'm a Grim Reaper?!

336
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,240
What does this mean?

337
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,240
Mihane..
- What?!

338
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,260
Shohei!
- Wait a sec..

339
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,810
Wait, it's okay. Just calm
down and tell me everything!

340
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:11,230
Please, calm down..
- Tell me, am I dead?!

341
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,730
I am a grim reaper, or a ghost? No way!
- You're not even dead, you're still alive!

342
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:21,230
The same moment was repeated?

343
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,810
You might be mistaken.

344
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:30,730
But, how about the turtle? Without realizing it,
I already hold that turtle. Is it even possible?!

345
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:34,220
With such pattern, huh?
- Yes, with that pattern.

346
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:42,730
That is a pattern of mixed memory, where you might
have mistaken your camera as that turtle (kame).

347
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:47,230
I see, they look similar..

348
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:51,740
Not similar at all!

349
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:56,240
I read it once in a manga.
Maybe that was a Time Leap!

350
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,230
Impossible, you're not "Urashima Taro"!

351
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,230
There is a legend of a fisherman who visited The Dragon God's Palace under the sea
for 3 days but found himself 300 years in the future when returned to his village.

352
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:02,710
Oh, that's it!

353
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,750
This turtle has that kind of power!

354
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,750
Urashima Taro (浦島 太郎), the fisherman in Japanese legend, was rewarded
with an invitation to visit The Dragon God's Palace because he rescued a turtle.

355
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,780
Eh?!

356
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,720
Mihane?

357
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,210
Mihane...?
- Once more!

358
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,230
Mihane?

359
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,230
Mihane-san..

360
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,770
You don't want people to think of you
like some dangerous person, right?

361
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:33,740
So, it's better for you not to say anything
about that 'time leap' thing to anyone.

362
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:39,000
Got it?

363
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,730
Do you understand?

364
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:42,730
I don't understand.

365
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:53,140
What are you doing?

366
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,110
Secret!

367
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:59,130
If I tell you that I can leap through time,
you will definitely make fun of me!

368
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:01,160
This should be a top secret!

369
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,220
Mom, Onee-chan becomes an idiot!

370
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,220
*older sister*

371
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:20,130
Why did I get this haircut?

372
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,680
07 JULY

373
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,800
06 JULY

374
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,630
I'm going to make you look cute, okay?

375
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,130
No..

376
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,630
No~

377
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,600
06 JULY

378
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,150
07 JULY

379
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,140
Eh, what was that?

380
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,110
Onee-chan, what's happened?

381
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,660
Aaaaa~ Cockroach! There is a cockroach!
- This is not the right time to worry about that.

382
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,730
Dad, there is a cockroach!
Come here faster, it's a cockroach!

383
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:52,120
It's not the turtle!

384
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,120
I can..

385
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,620
..leap through time?!

386
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:18,000
06 JULY

387
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,140
I'm going to make you look cute, okay?

388
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,130
Don't cut it!

389
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,130
Whoa, yeay!

390
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:30,130
I don't have that weird haircut anymore!

391
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,900
Leap!

392
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,110
I can leap through time!

393
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,630
That's dangerous!

394
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,170
"Today is July 7th, the day of Tanabata Festival."

395
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:52,130
"Everyone, please do write your wish on Tanzaku."

396
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,500
Look!

397
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,000
This looks nice, right?

398
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,130
So, I allowed you to go to that
hair saloon for nothing, huh?

399
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,120
That's why I did it!

400
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,620
Bon apetite!

401
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,620
"Here is the girl who found it, Onishi-san."

402
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:08,120
"Could you tell us about the situation
there, when you found that fish?"

403
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:19,120
Even though you already have a girlfriend, and don't even care with her hairstyle?!

404
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,640
My stomach hurts..

405
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,180
The difference between 3 and 1 is 2,
so we should multiply this with 1/2.

406
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:33,130
Which means, the main point is
to break apart the partial-fraction!

407
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:35,140
Easy, right?

408
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,140
Well then, for the next similar problem..

409
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,120
Who is going to solve this?

410
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,620
Me!

411
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:50,720
Even snow could fall soon, right?

412
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:50,720
*he is comparing how rare for Mihane to solve such problem with the possibility of snowfall in the middle of summer*

413
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,620
I've prepared myself for this.

414
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,620
You can do it, afterall.

415
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:08,630
Cool, you can catch it in time!

416
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,620
I'm shocked!

417
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,620
Ouch, what the heck..

418
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:25,120
No way!

419
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,140
You become so wet.

420
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,140
Water~

421
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,210
Wait, not this one!

422
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:34,710
Why?
- Because, it's broken.

423
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,630
Here, this one.

424
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,620
Jan-ken-pon!

425
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,120
Really?!

426
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,640
CHOCOLATE~

427
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,640
This time, the word is チョコレート or "Chi-yo-ko-re-i-to" (Chokoreeto).

428
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,640
Goal, yeay!

429
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,610
Wait a sec..

430
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:51,680
You never lose even once,
by the theory, it's too strange.

431
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,230
Because I did it seriously!

432
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:58,120
The one who ends up lost
should treat us juices, okay?

433
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,120
Keep your promise!
- I will definitely win!

434
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,140
Jan-ken-pon!

435
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,640
Once more.

436
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,590
This sound..

437
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,580
..and this rhythm..

438
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:19,100
..make me so comfortable
that it may make me fall asleep.

439
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,580
Back then, you often fell asleep here.

440
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:25,250
Goro helped me keeping your head up
when I was cutting your hair, so nostalgic..

441
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:28,610
Since Mihane came here, you kinda
became the flower of this barbershop.

442
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,590
Mostly because no other female
customer would come here after that.

443
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,800
Also, there has been no young
male customers since then.

444
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,200
Ah, I see.

445
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,600
How about you?
Want to cut your hair?

446
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,920
No, for now..

447
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,610
I can cut your hair to look more share-otsu!

448
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:45,160
Share-otsu is a popular slang in 90s, a reverse pronunciation of "oshare" (fashionable).
He said "share-ostu ni NAU" and ((nau)) seems considered a lame pun for ((now)).

449
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:45,160
Saying it proves that you're old, Dad!

450
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,560
Back then, your dad was handsome.

451
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,860
You were also a pretty woman, back then.

452
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,860
Beppin-san is a term/nickname used to define a beautiful lady.

453
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,600
Time is so cruel, right?

454
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,610
You're also part of this family!

455
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,900
Power outage?

456
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,000
Mihane, bring me the flashlight.

457
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,390
Ah, thank you!

458
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:23,910
What are doing?

459
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:26,470
Eh, what's that?

460
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,900
I heard something..
- What is it?

461
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,750
Please, be careful..

462
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:36,140
Mom, there is a fire!
- Fire? Where?

463
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,140
Look, there!
- That's far from here.

464
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,160
Smokes are coming out.
- Ah, you're right!

465
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,670
It's near Goro-chan's house.
- Goro-chan? Asakura's house?

466
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:47,170
I have to go there.
- Wait, Mihane!

467
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,660
Mihane!

468
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:59,650
Goro-chan, glad you're okay!

469
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:02,150
Seems there was a fire outbreak
from the sub-station nearby.

470
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,140
Shohei.. Shohei!

471
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,660
How is it?

472
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:12,730
It's been extinguished now.
- Really? Thank goodness!

473
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:24,640
Only by having a small chance, she is is now at
the center of attention. She is amazing, isn't she?

474
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,190
But since the beginning, seems
she has the talent to shine, right?

475
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,710
Right..

476
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:31,150
The talent to shine, huh?

477
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:37,150
I also have such thing.

478
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:37,940
Eh?

479
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:44,160
What do you mean?
- I also have that!

480
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,030
5 seconds left!

481
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:55,030
4.. 3.. 2..

482
00:32:56,310 --> 00:33:03,000
"A very rare and the so-called sea monster, The Giant
Oarfish was found in Fujiura Coast, Shizuoka Prefecture."

483
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,910
07 JULY

484
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
"Here is the girl who found it, Yoshiyama-san. Could you
tell us about the situation there, when you found that fish?"

485
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,300
"Something terrible would probably happen soon. Since long, Oarfish is known for..."

486
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:16,320
Wow, you're in a nationwide broadcast!

487
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:22,820
"Known for its trait that makes people called it
as a sea monster, Oarfish has a silver body and..."

488
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,990
What are you planning to do?

489
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:30,910
I want to be a celebrity.
Like, being an idol?

490
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:34,420
In this era, your face..

491
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:37,420
No matter how cute my face is,
it won't ever be enough to be an idol.

492
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,910
I got it.

493
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:42,910
She just called herself "cute", huh?
- Indeed, she did.

494
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:46,960
That's why, I'm gonna be a clairvoyant idol.

495
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,480
Okay..

496
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,900
I will shock the entire world.

497
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:56,900
Record it properly, like this!
- Yes, I'm taking this properly.

498
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:04,450
Tonight at 08.10 pm, there would be fire outbreak
at the electricity sub-station near Asakura Barbershop.

499
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,850
It will cause a power outage in Fujiura.

500
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,080
Don't say things that would jinx us!

501
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,520
I'm telling the truth!

502
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,990
The fire will get extinguished
quickly, nothing to worry about.

503
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:17,990
If it's true, then it's okay..
- Let's introduce the staff!

504
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:22,520
The one who dreams to be a charismatic
barbershop owner, Goro-chan and..

505
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:28,100
..the one who loves to wear
 a polka dot pajama, Shohei-kun.

506
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:30,840
Really?
- I don't even have a polka dot pajama!

507
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,860
No, I saw you wore it!

508
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,340
You saw me?
What do you mean?

509
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,860
If you upload this on the net,
people will laugh at you!

510
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,860
I wonder..

511
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:45,870
Well then, everyone..
Please look forward for it!

512
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:48,420
Here they come..

513
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,340
There's another unit coming!

514
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:56,860
See? My prediction comes true!

515
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:00,850
Eh? Polka dot?
- Here he comes!

516
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:03,370
It's a polka dot pajama!
- No, it's not like that.

517
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:06,910
My mom just bought it today and
I couldn't refuse it, so I wear it.

518
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:09,460
You're right!

519
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:17,850
Amazing~

520
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:31,420
"Video of a Japanese high school girl whose miraculous
prediction came true, has been going viral on the internet."

521
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:39,860
"In her first video uploaded on the net, she predicted that there
would be a fire outbreak around 8pm at a sub-station in Fujiura."

522
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:45,850
"Both the time and place of the incident that
she predicted, have been proven accurately true."

523
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:49,870
"Meanwhile, on the same day at 9am, there
was a similar accident occured in Wisconsin."

524
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:56,360
"The suspect who hid in a junior high school building,
is a man from South Ireland who has been arrested now."

525
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,360
"But the video from the clairvoyant idol, Mihane..."

526
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:06,140
08 JULY

527
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:12,940
I am now a famous celebrity!

528
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:16,750
I'm starting to enjoy my life!

529
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:19,850
How about stop being one?
- You think, I would do more?

530
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:27,340
I think, it's better for someone who gives
lots of effort like her, to get such attention.

531
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,380
You said it as if I was not
making any effort, huh?

532
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,450
Were you?
- I'm not the type who tends to show it.

533
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:38,450
You used to make lots of effort
before you left the boat club.

534
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:43,360
My back was hurt,
there's nothing I can do.

535
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,860
Despite joining a photography club,
you're still not making efforts?

536
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:53,850
Do you really wanna be a celebrity?

537
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,450
Since you don't know
what you really want to do..

538
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:02,450
You just seem like desperately trying
to enjoy being the center of attention.

539
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,860
Goro-chan, you know nothing about it.

540
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:20,410
It's Yoshiyama!

541
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:23,360
She is so cute!

542
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,350
Do your best!

543
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:29,870
How about tomorrow's Tanabata Festival?
You will go there with us, right?

544
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:33,860
Seems pprobably not, or else
my fans would gather around us.

545
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,340
Mihane-senpai!
Goro-senpai!

546
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,410
Good afternoon!
- Good afternoon!

547
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:41,960
Mihane-senpai, I will be in charge of bowing
in the upcoming beginner competition.

548
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,850
I'm going to carry on
the same courage as yours!

549
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:47,350
We will do our best!
- Yes, do your best.

550
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,370
Thank you, please do your best!

551
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:52,370
If you wouldn't mind,
please come and cheer for us!

552
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:07,840
That girl obviously did a time leap!

553
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,380
So, what should we do?

554
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,500
We can only watch over her, right?

555
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,860
You're mad at me?
Whose fault do you think is it?!

556
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,880
The world begins to fall into chaos!

557
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,380
The drug's effect will start vanishing soon.

558
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,350
Onee-chan is also popular in my class!

559
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,870
So, you finally start to respect me?

560
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:36,350
I always knew that you have such
talent. Give me an autograph later!

561
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,850
Onishi!

562
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:49,850
Do a backstroke!
Start swimming now!

563
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:55,370
Backstroke is a swimming style in which the swimmer performing backstroke lies flat
on the back; arms stretched with extended fingertips, and legs extended backwards.

564
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:53,370
Swim faster, we're going to record it.

565
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:55,370
Come on, do a backstroke!

566
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:57,370
Look, she's been recording you.

567
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:00,890
Let's not getting involved, okay?

568
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:02,930
Let's head back!

569
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:04,460
HEY!

570
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,350
Why are you bullying her?

571
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:08,370
I'm gonna call the police!

572
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:10,850
Police?
No way, let's go!

573
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:14,350
Police?
Sounds boring!

574
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:29,870
Onishi-san..

575
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:32,370
Are you alright?

576
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:46,630
09 JULY

577
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:23,360
Onee-chan, the police has come.

578
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,860
Police?

579
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:32,370
Yoshiyama Mihane-san?

580
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:33,750
Ah, yes.

581
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:38,900
Would you come with us to talk about
the fire outbreak happened on July 7th?

582
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,360
Why were you there?

583
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,370
I thought, it's almost the time of occurance.

584
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:50,370
How did you know about it?

585
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:54,150
That's because.. something
that I can not explain.

586
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,250
Because you're the one who caused it, right?

587
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,910
I didn't cause it!

588
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:59,910
Just tell us the truth..

589
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:06,870
If I tell you the truth, will you believe me?

590
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:08,370
Of course.

591
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:18,360
I can leap through time.

592
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:23,370
Don't understimate us!

593
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:26,870
Enough, why don't you tell us the truth?

594
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,840
I can leap through time.

595
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,880
Hey, tell us the truth..

596
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,920
I can leap through time!

597
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:43,860
Fireworks, huh?

598
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,340
It's time for Tanabata Festival.

599
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,860
After all..

600
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,380
I'm not cut out to be an idol.

601
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,860
Eh?

602
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:07,350
Well then, yoroshiku onegaishimasu!

603
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:11,410
06 JULY

604
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:09,360
5 seconds left!

605
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,360
4.. 3.. 2..

606
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:16,860
"I didn't expect to see an Oarfish here."

607
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:18,700
07 JULY

608
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:21,440
"Something terrible would probably happen soon.."

609
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,360
Wow, she is in a nationwide-broadcast news!

610
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,360
I'm fine being an ordinary high schooler.

611
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:34,360
It's not good to cause too many uproar.

612
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,630
Thanks for the food.
- You're welcome.

613
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:39,140
Onee-chan, the ice cream
in the fridge is mine...

614
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:43,620
You're already eating it?!
- Don't worry, I'll buy you one later.

615
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:47,600
She piss me off! Mom, you should prick
this b*tch with thousands of needles!

616
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,610
Naho, don't call her "b*tch"!

617
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:53,610
I'm leaving now.

618
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:56,600
Mihane, go change your clothes!

619
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,150
I wanna sleep a bit more.

620
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:02,600
Even though you always have a perfect
attendance since you're in kindegarten?

621
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,100
No worries at all, my perfect
attendance will keep continuing!

622
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:09,110
What?

623
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:33,710
09 JULY

624
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,970
Sorry..

625
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:48,970
Shohei has something else to do,
so he couldn't come with us.

626
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:51,980
Eh? Too bad..

627
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:54,460
Even though this would probably be
the last time we could go together.

628
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:57,470
That's why, let's enjoy this festival!

629
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:59,990
Okay~

630
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:04,570
Anyway, I'm wearing a yukata.
Is there no reaction at all?

631
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:08,480
Yes, you're really..

632
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,480
..cute.

633
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,480
Sounds too forced.

634
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:26,560
Afterall, fireworks are much
better seen from up close, right?

635
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,560
Here is the octopus.

636
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:31,970
Here.

637
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:37,490
When will you be able to eat the octopus?

638
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:40,490
This grilled flour-ball is more delicious.

639
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,470
Being able to go to a festival as an ordinary
high school girl, makes me so happy.

640
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:53,470
You said it as if you're an idol.

641
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:55,470
I was an idol!

642
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:57,980
The most popular idol in the world.

643
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:00,460
Oh.. in your dream?

644
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:05,000
You should just be grateful to be
able to come to this festival with me.

645
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,570
For that, I am so grateful.
- You're welcome!

646
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:11,990
That's why..
- Eh?

647
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:14,990
Would you be my bride?

648
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,970
Stupid..
- No, I'm serious.

649
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:24,470
Would you be alright if
I ask you to be my girlfriend?

650
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,490
Eh?

651
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,480
Would you?

652
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:36,980
Goro-chan, your serious face is weird!

653
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:38,980
I'm asking you seriously.

654
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:43,070
I want you to be my girlfriend.

655
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,980
It's hot!

656
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,480
Sorry..

657
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:58,990
Shohei has something else to do,
so he couldn't come with us.

658
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:01,490
Oh, I see..

659
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,010
Your yukata looks cute.

660
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,460
I mean, Mihane looks cute in that yukata.

661
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,460
Thank you.

662
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:14,970
What's wrong?
You act so weird.

663
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:18,470
Not at all.

664
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:24,490
Back then, we used to hold hands
like this so we wouldn't get separated.

665
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:30,080
Whoa, Takoyaki!

666
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:39,960
You can eat the octopus now, huh?

667
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,980
I would still eat it for you, though.

668
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:44,980
Because, I'm already 18 years old.

669
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,980
Goro-chan, the octopus..
- Would you go out with me?

670
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,460
Both of us.

671
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:05,470
Why suddenly talk about it when
we're still talking about the octopus?

672
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:10,470
This whole day, I had always been
looking for the right timing.

673
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:18,470
I like Mihane.

674
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:26,480
I like you.

675
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:31,550
I said, I like you!

676
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:37,950
Sorry..

677
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:42,950
Shohei has something else to do..
- For now, I don't need a boyfriend.

678
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,960
Why said it?
All of a sudden.

679
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,460
Yosh, let's watch the fireworks!

680
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:57,020
I want to be Mihane's boyfriend.

681
00:47:58,470 --> 00:47:59,970
I like you.

682
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:06,970
Ouch!

683
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:08,470
Eh?

684
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:10,970
Why didn't you come to the festival?

685
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:12,300
08 JULY

686
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:13,000
I didn't come?

687
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,560
But the festival is tomorrow, right?

688
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:19,480
Ah, right..
It's tomorrow.

689
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:23,470
Tomorrow, you would have to do something
and you couldn't come to the festival.

690
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:25,970
And then, Goro-chan..

691
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:30,460
Anyway, I'm in a pinch!

692
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:31,960
Okay..

693
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:37,060
Let's go together to the festival!

694
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:42,060
But, Goro told me not
to go together with you.

695
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:48,970
Eh? So, that's why..

696
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:50,980
Eh?

697
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:54,460
So..

698
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:59,530
Goro-chan..

699
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:02,990
..is in love with me.

700
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:04,490
Love?

701
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:08,980
Since we have always been together..

702
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:12,980
Our relationship right now is more precious.

703
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:15,970
Love..

704
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:18,020
How does it feel?

705
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:21,070
That thing called "love"?

706
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:25,960
Well, I used to hear that such thing existed in the past. Despite hearing such thing..

707
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:29,980
Sorry, what I meant by
"in the past" is actually "now".

708
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:35,480
How does it feel?
"L.O.V.E."

709
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:44,520
I consult with the wrong person.

710
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:51,970
Anyway, you should come to the festival!

711
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:53,970
Come, okay?!

712
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:00,980
Love..

713
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:02,480
Love~

714
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:14,480
This is yummy!

715
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:18,460
Yummy~

716
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:22,000
Mom, have you ever fallen in love?

717
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,050
Why did you suddenly ask?

718
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:27,970
I wonder if I can fall in love.

719
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:32,990
They say, falling in love
is not a natural thing.

720
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:38,480
500 years ago during a war period,
political marriages was a common thing.

721
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:43,150
Even in 100 years from now,
love is not going to exist.

722
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:47,480
Because a couple would be decided by
the compatibility of their genetic traits.

723
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:51,460
No one can't fall in love.

724
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:53,480
Really?
- Yes.

725
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,970
Slowly looking for love would also be fine.

726
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,970
I see..

727
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:15,950
Each of them are the same!

728
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:17,970
Failed another Goukon, huh?

729
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:17,970
Goukon (合コン) is an organized group dating that is popular in Japan.

730
00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:20,490
I'm quite popular, you know..

731
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:23,040
But, they are all too shy.

732
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,460
If only they can be more assertive..

733
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:28,460
I would straightly fall in love, right?

734
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:32,990
Welcome!
- Thank you.

735
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:38,460
Maekawa-sensei?

736
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:41,010
Yano-sensei?

737
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:43,050
You often come to this shop?

738
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:45,050
Yes, sometimes.

739
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:50,460
Isn't it too far?
Is your relationship bad?

740
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:51,960
No..

741
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:55,480
Well then, may I sit beside you?

742
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:58,980
Of course.

743
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,530
What would you like to drink?
- Beer.

744
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:04,570
Okay..
- One beer!

745
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:08,570
Have some snacks.
- Oh, thank you!

746
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,980
When you help someone in a pinch
situation, love will starts blooming.

747
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:22,480
Helping those in a pinch? Love..

748
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:28,570
09 JULY

749
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:36,480
Sorry..

750
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,470
Shohei has something else to do,
so he couldn't come with us.

751
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:40,470
He already did that thing!

752
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:43,990
This "Kakigori" thing tastes extremely good!

753
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:43,990
Kakigori (かき氷) is a Japanese shaved ice dessert flavored with
syrup and a sweetener, and often also with condensed milk.

754
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:48,480
Since this is the last, it would be
nice if we go together, right?

755
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,980
Right.
- Yummy~

756
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:57,970
From the moment I realized that I can leap through time..

757
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:02,980
I don't want to force myself trying to have a date.

758
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:07,980
Because both my first boyfriend and my first love..

759
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,150
..should not be something that can be repeated, ever.

760
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:21,500
You're covering me, move aside!
- Move closer, are you ready?

761
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,980
Yosh, take it!
- Okay~

762
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:28,990
Did you take it?
- Yes, I did.

763
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:30,990
Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure!

764
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:35,560
So slow..

765
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,980
That's why I said
I would buy it for her.

766
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:40,480
Frozen pineapple tastes so good!

767
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,970
That good?
- Yes, this is scary..

768
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:44,970
This is too good.
It scares me off!

769
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:49,990
What a yummy frozen pineapple!

770
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:53,010
Thank you.
- Your welcome.

771
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:55,010
Yakisoba!

772
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:55,010
Yakisoba (焼きそば/fried buckwheat), is a classic Japanese street food made by stir-frying
boiled ramen noodles, vegetables, and meat/seafood with a sweet and savory sauce.

773
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,980
Eh?
- What is it?

774
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:16,480
Someone, help!

775
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:27,490
Let's hold this, 1.. 2..
- Are you alright?

776
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:29,990
Shohei!
- Hey, are you okay?

777
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:33,490
1.. 2..
- Shohei!

778
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:38,980
Shohei!

779
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:46,570
No!

780
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:09,980
Shohei! Shohei!

781
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:12,980
This is too good.
It scares me off!

782
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:15,970
Watch out!

783
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:27,980
Shohei!

784
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:29,980
Watch out!

785
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:35,970
Ouch..

786
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,500
What are you doing?

787
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:43,510
Ah, pineapple..

788
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:47,990
Thank goodness!

789
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:50,000
Thank goodness, you're safe!

790
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,990
Nothing is safe!
My frozen pineapple?!

791
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:56,480
What's wrong?

792
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:01,480
This thing would fall soon and
Shohei would be trapped under it.

793
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:04,550
That would be terribly!

794
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:06,590
I'm telling the truth!

795
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:08,010
This is dangerous.

796
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:09,970
We should change the rope.
Bring me the new ones.

797
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:11,990
Okay~

798
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:15,980
I thought you're gonna die!

799
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:19,480
I thought it was too late..

800
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:23,540
Thank goodness, you're still alive!

801
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:26,990
Why are you crying?

802
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:30,980
I'm worried, you fool!

803
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:33,000
Don't laugh!

804
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,980
You're crying too much.
- Don't laugh at me!

805
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:40,980
Because you're crying..
- I'm not crying!

806
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:45,970
This Frankfurt Sausage is too delicious, right?

807
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:48,810
Anyway, why Frankfurt?

808
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:51,060
Go search it on the net!
- What kind of fruit is so frank?

809
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:51,060
*He mistook (Frank)furt, which is spelled as フルト (furuto), as fruit?!*

810
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:54,570
Frank? I don't know.
- Too delicious!

811
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:58,620
Let me walk you home.

812
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:02,580
I need to scold Shohei about something,
so I'm going home with Shohei instead.

813
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:05,580
Wait, you're still mad about it?

814
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:07,560
I still don't get why, though..
- See you tomorrow!

815
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,560
Ah.. No, see you on monday.

816
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:13,550
Bye~ Bye~ Bee~

817
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:18,050
Goro-chan, please walk with
me instead. Goro-chan..

818
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:37,560
Why do have to scold me?

819
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,060
That was a lie.

820
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,600
Eh?

821
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,650
Because today I can't let myself
being alone with Goro-chan.

822
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:50,150
Oh, because he would confess to you?

823
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:54,070
I'm so cruel, right?

824
00:57:56,060 --> 00:58:04,090
I'm not so sure, but seems this girl had
leapt through time and saved my life.

825
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:06,610
Her crying face looked so weird..

826
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:10,610
..but, it made me happy.

827
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:19,080
Sorry!

828
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:28,560
In the past, I was often chased by dogs.

829
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:31,110
Go away!

830
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:33,670
Go away!

831
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:36,070
They always chased me.

832
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:38,070
I was so scared.

833
00:58:38,070 --> 00:58:40,090
Are you alright, Mihane?

834
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:44,580
Mihane, it's okay now.

835
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:48,100
That time..

836
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:51,600
Goro-chan was desperately trying to save me.

837
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:04,580
No, that's me.

838
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:10,570
Shohei was desperately trying to save you.

839
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:17,160
That time, Shohei was
desperately trying to save me.

840
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,080
So nostalgic, huh?

841
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:22,080
Indeed!

842
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:24,570
Hey!
- Cut it out!

843
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:26,070
What's with these messages?!

844
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:28,570
Don't look at this phone
without my permission!

845
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:30,570
You're the worst!

846
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:33,070
That hurts..

847
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:38,130
One love just disappeared from the world.

848
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:48,090
If you're falling in love,
that kind of ending awaits you.

849
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:52,560
That's why I'm scared.

850
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:55,060
You're talking about.. Goro?

851
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,580
It would be better if we just
keep being best friends like this.

852
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:07,560
When was the last time we
talked like this? I can't remember.

853
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:11,580
Me too, but I'm glad we can talk a lot.

854
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:13,580
Right.

855
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:19,590
See you.

856
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,080
This yukata looks good.

857
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:33,570
Good night.

858
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:47,550
Mihane, 5 minutes left.

859
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:49,570
Five minutes?

That girl's love might be able to conveyed through a photo.

Wanna try to kiss?

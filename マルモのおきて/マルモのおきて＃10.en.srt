1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,010
Marumo, is Oba-chan our mommy?

2
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:14,010
Is Mommy alive?

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,010
Kaoru.

4
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:21,020
Marumo, is Oba-chan our mommy?

5
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:26,020
Wh-What are you saying.
How can that be?

6
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,020
Where did that come from?

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,030
Who's this? Mommy, right?

8
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:36,030
Yeah.
That's you guys' mommy.

9
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,040
-It's Oba-chan, right?
-No it isn't.

10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,040
-But she looks just like her.
-I said it's not. Let me see that.

11
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,050
This does look like her, but
her hairstyle's different and she has a different aura.

12
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,050
They're not the same person.

13
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:56,050
Listen, Kaoru. It's said that

14
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,050
there are three people who look exactly alike in this world.

15
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,990
So it's not strange that there are people who look alike, right?

16
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,990
People tell me I have look-alikes too.

17
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:09,000
Like that Cat Girl*.
(*from GeGeGe no Kitaro)

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And Catbus*.
(*from My Neighbor Totoro)

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And an alien.

20
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,010
Anyway,

21
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,010
it's late so go to sleep for today.
Okay?

22
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:37,030
Marumo, can I have that picture?

23
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:41,030
-Huh?
-Because I don't have any pictures of Mommy.

24
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:44,030
Oh, okay.

25
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,040
-Don't lose it.
-Okay, thanks. Good night.

26
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,040
Good night.

27
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,070
-Hey, Kaori, Tomoki, you're gonna be late
-That's right.

28
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,990
Marumo, can you come to the information meeting for sports day?

29
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,990
Teacher said it's okay if you can't make it.

30
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,990
He said he'll pass out the printout later.

31
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,990
Today at 3, right?  That should be fine.

32
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,990
-I'll just take some time off and go.
-Okay.

33
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm going first then.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
-See you later.
-See you later.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay, I'm going.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Okay, I'm going, Mook.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
-Bye bye.
-Bye bye.

38
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,010
Tomoki, look at this.

39
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,010
What is it?

40
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,020
I got it from Marumo. It's a picture of Mommy.

41
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,020
What? Is that really Mommy?

42
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,020
Yeah.

43
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,020
She looks like Oba-chan, doesn't she?

44
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:45,030
Yeah, I think so too, but
she isn't, is she?

45
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,030
Probably not.

46
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,030
You know Mommy died.

47
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,030
And Oba-chan's alive.

48
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,040
I guess.

49
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,040
Maybe she's a spirit.

50
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,040
What, a ghost?

51
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,980
Is this Sunday the sports day?

52
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,980
Yeah, that's right. I'm so looking forward to it.

53
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,990
The thing to remember on sports day is to secure a spot.

54
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,990
-Secure a spot?
-When you get there in the morning

55
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,990
make sure you find a spot where you can get an unobstructed view of the children.

56
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,990
-Wow, spoken like a true veteran.
-Thanks, I'll keep that in mind.

57
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,000
I'll get it.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Hello, Customer Service. This is Mashima.

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Ah, how are you. Yes.

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So the time's been changed from 1:00 to 3:00.

61
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:34,010
Is this Oyaji-san?
Is Aya-chan there?

62
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:37,010
She went out saying something about going to a movie with a friend.

63
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,020
Oh, is that right.

64
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,020
What? Did you need something?

65
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:46,020
Actually, there's an information meeting for the sports day today at 3.

66
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,020
I was planning to go, but

67
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,030
the time for a meeting I have to attend suddenly changed.

68
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:57,030
Ah, information meeting, huh?

69
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,050
The students have been practicing the song they're dancing to on sports day.

70
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,970
In order for them to be able to practice at home,

71
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,980
I'd like all of you to learn the dance as well.

72
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,980
Alright.
Let me show you

73
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,980
how it's done first.

74
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,980
First, pose like a monkey.

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Stop. Wait a minute.

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Kaoru, okay.

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Tomoki, there's something wrong with yours.

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,010
You're bow legged, and
you're kinda flopping around.

79
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,010
Watch me, okay? Like this.
-"Ai ai" cutely.

80
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,010
Okay, try it.

81
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,020
It's still not right, but we'll let it go for now.

82
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,020
It'll work out if you practice.

83
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,020
I'm home.

84
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,030
-Hi.
-Oh, hi.

85
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,030
Oyaji-san, sorry for troubling you today and thanks.

86
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,000
I don't mind once in a while.

87
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,870
-Oh, here's the printout.
-Yes yes.

88
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,870
Let's see...
We can go secure a spot from 6 am.

89
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,870
No staking out on the school ground from the day before.

90
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,870
Alright, got it.

91
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,880
Marumo, Oyaji-san learned the dance for us.

92
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,880
Seriously? That's great.

93
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,880
You know that "Ai ai," right?

94
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,880
The high point of the song is a bit difficult.

95
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,880
Watch. Like this.

96
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:28,890
You try it.

97
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,890
Me?
Yeah.

98
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,900
Dad, customers are starting to come.

99
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,910
-Wh-what are you doing?
-Oh, I'll be right there.

100
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,910
-We'll continue tomorrow, okay?
-Yes.

101
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,910
-Alright, tomorrow then.
-Thank you.

102
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,910
-Thanks.
-We'll keep on practicing.

103
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,920
Yeah, practice hard.

104
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,920
This is pretty hard.♪♪「アイアイ」
難しいな　これ　おい。

105
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,920
-No, no, you have to concentrate more.
-Huh?

106
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,960
Your hand movement's dead too.

107
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
-This is fun.
-It's good.

108
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The person who invented this is a genius, huh?

109
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,010
-This is the last of it.
-Oh, there's a red one in there.

110
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,010
Whoever eats this is the lucky one.

111
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,010
-I wanna eat it.
-I want to eat it.

112
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,020
-Me me me me.
-Me me.

113
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,950
Okay, okay, okay. Let's decide who gets the last bite by rock paper scissors.

114
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,950
Here we go. Ready.

115
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,960
First is rock.
Rock paper scissors.

116
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,960
-Huh?
-Huh?

117
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,960
-You.
-It's rock.

118
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,970
No, that's paper. Yeah, paper.

119
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,970
But it's rock.

120
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,980
I win. I get to eat.

121
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:33,980
Mommy, thanks for the clothes.

122
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,990
Can I wear it to school tomorrow?

123
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,990
-Of course you can.
-Yay!

124
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,990
What shall we do about dinner?

125
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,990
-Say, Marumo.
-Hm?

126
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,000
You met Mommy before, didn't you?

127
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah, I did.

128
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
-Where's Mommy sleeping?
-Huh?

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Same place as Daddy?

130
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,010
Uh...No.
It's someplace else...probably.

131
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,030
Why not?
Don't families go into the same grave?

132
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,950
Where's Mommy's grave?

133
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,950
-Um..That's...um.
-I want to visit Mommy's grave too.

134
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,950
I've never been there, you know.

135
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,950
Yeah.
Daddy didn't take us.

136
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,960
Uh...Uh... Some other time, okay?

137
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,960
It might be a little far.

138
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,960
Yeah, that's probably it.
It's far.

139
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,960
Yeah, some other time.

140
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,990
Hello, this is Takagi.

141
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,990
This is Aoki.
I'm sorry for calling so late at night.

142
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:54,000
Ayumi-san, did something happen?

143
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Can you set aside some time for me tomorrow?

144
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,970
I'd like to talk to you about the children.

145
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,980
-What's going on?
-Stuff for the cheering section.

146
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,980
We all brought something in.

147
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,990
The kids are putting in a lot of effort, so the parents have to too.

148
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,990
Is that right?
But what's this?

149
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,990
I brought that.

150
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,990
I wore that and danced at an athletic festival.

151
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,000
We all lined up behind each other

152
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
-like this.
-Wait.

153
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I think I've done that too.

154
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
This might work.
Hey, hey, hey.

155
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Line up behind me. Line up.
Hurry, hurry.

156
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,010
-Kana-san, you too. Hurry.
-Me too?

157
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,010
All aboard. Go.

158
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,010
-What do you think?
-Pretty good, huh?

159
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,020
This is fun.

160
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,020
Okay, then gather at 8 on Sunday morning.

161
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,020
-Takagi-kun.
-Yes.

162
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:35,020
Do you have time after lunch?

163
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:38,030
Yes.

164
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:42,030
I told you a little bit about it last time too, but

165
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:45,030
it seems the Product Development people want

166
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:49,050
to have you transferred back there after all.

167
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:52,980
-Huh?
-Of course, I would

168
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,980
like for you to stay in this department forever.

169
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:01,980
It would be better for the twins as well.

170
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:07,990
However, product development is what you've always wanted to do.

171
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:13,000
This might be the beginning of a great opportunity for you.

172
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So think about it.
It's your life after all.

173
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Thank you for your concern.

174
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,020
It's the Boss.

175
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,030
The Goma Shio Boss.

176
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,030
Boss?

177
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,030
Boss, g'day.

178
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,030
Yeah, take it easy.

179
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:55,970
Awesome.
I wonder if he came out of goma shio.

180
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,970
I should've asked for an autograph.

181
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,970
Ah~ I blew my chance.

182
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,980
-Hello.
-Ah, yes.

183
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,990
Excuse me. We saw the poster outside.

184
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,990
The poster?

185
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,990
-About the lost dog.
-Ah.

186
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:21,000
He may be our dog.

187
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Oh, is that right?

188
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,010
Excuse me for calling you out so suddenly.

189
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:34,010
First of all, I wanted to return this.

190
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:37,010
Kaoru's clothes.

191
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:40,010
I had taken the dirty clothes home with me last time.

192
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,020
Thanks for taking the trouble to return them.

193
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,960
I'm really sorry about the last time.

194
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:00,970
Me too.
I was a bit harsh.

195
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,970
I happened to see Kaoru fall down on my way home from work.

196
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:09,980
I couldn't leave her there and found myself talking to her.

197
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:13,980
I forgot about the time and took her all over.

198
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,990
I hear they're dancing to "Ai Ai" on sports day.

199
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,990
She looked so happy talking about it.

200
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,000
I bet Kaoru and Tomoki will be really cute.

201
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yes. I'm looking forward to it.

202
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm sorry.

203
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:46,010
Um...You said you had something to talk about?

204
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:49,010
Ah, yes.

205
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,970
What kind of work are you doing now, Ayumi-san?

206
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,970
I'm working in a medical office right now.

207
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:13,980
I got my certificate immediately after I divorced Junichirou.

208
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,980
-I see.
-What about you, Takagi-san?

209
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,980
Do you have plans to get married?

210
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,990
I don't think marriage is in my future anymore.

211
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,990
Perhaps, is it because of the children?

212
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,990
-No, that's not it.
-But

213
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,990
you have a job too, and I'm afraid they're a burden to you.

214
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:36,000
No, I don't feel that way at all.
Everything's fine.

215
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Anyway, please don't worry about the children.

216
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,010
I will take good care of them.

217
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,690
-Mook's owner?
-Yeah.

218
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,690
That's the point of contact.

219
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,690
Can you give them a call?

220
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,690
I wonder if it's really Mook.

221
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:19,700
I understand the dog disappeared about 3 months ago,

222
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,700
and they reported it to the police but was never found,

223
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,700
so they've been looking ever since.

224
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,710
We have to say good-bye to Mook?

225
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,710
I don't want to do that.

226
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:37,720
We don't know yet.
We don't know, but

227
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,720
if they're really Mook's owner,

228
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,720
-we have to return him.
-Why?

229
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,730
No. Never.

230
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,730
Isn't Mook family?
Isn't he part of our family?

231
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:55,730
Yeah, he's our family now.

232
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,740
Then let's just stay together like this.

233
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:02,760
Me too. I'd like to do that too.

234
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,680
But no matter how much we like Mook,

235
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,680
Mook isn't ours.

236
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,690
Mook already had a family before us.

237
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:20,690
Those people have been waiting to live with Mook for a long time.

238
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:24,690
We can't take him away from them.

239
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,700
We have to give Mook back to them.

240
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,700
I don't want to say bye bye to Mook.

241
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,710
Mook is going to stay with us.

242
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,710
No.

243
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:39,710
I don't want to part with him!

244
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,730
How about a drink?

245
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,730
Yes.

246
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,670
Here.

247
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,680
I had a hard time calming them down.
They were crying and screaming.

248
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,690
I'm sure they're

249
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,690
heartbroken about Mook.

250
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:30,700
I'm heartbroken too.

251
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:37,700
About Mook.
And about Ayumi-san too.

252
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:43,710
I tried to convince the kids

253
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:47,710
because they were saying they didn't part with Mook.

254
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:51,720
Mook isn't ours.

255
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,720
He already had a family so we should return him.

256
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:05,660
As I was talking, I started thinking,

257
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,660
"Hey, wait. Am I talking about myself?"

258
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,670
And so you thought

259
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:17,680
you should return the kids to Ayumi-san.

260
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,680
Yes.

261
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,690
I don't know what to do.

262
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:33,690
Of course, when I think about Sasakura,

263
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:38,700
there's no way I can hand over the kids to Ayumi-san.

264
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,700
He died, trying to raise the kids all by himself.

265
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,700
I can never do anything that would betray him.

266
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:57,720
Besides, I want to stay with those kids forever too.

267
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,670
Do you think Mook won't come back anymore?

268
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:24,680
Marumo's terrible, isn't he?

269
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:45,700
Excuse me, are you Takagi-san?

270
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,700
Yes.

271
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,700
I'm Izumi, the one who took your call.

272
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,700
-Thank you for coming.
-No, thank you.

273
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,710
Mook.

274
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,650
What do you think?

275
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,660
They look alike but...

276
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:27,670
No, it's not our Ranko.

277
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,680
I'm sorry I couldn't be of help.

278
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,690
No, no, that's alright. Thank you.

279
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,690
Thank you for making time to come here.

280
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,690
If it's alright with you,

281
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,700
please give this to Mook-chan.

282
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,700
It's our Ranko's favorite.

283
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:59,700
Thank you.
Seems I caused you more trouble than anything.

284
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,640
I hope you find Ranko-chan.

285
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,650
Yes. Thank you very much.

286
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,670
I felt bad for them.

287
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:36,680
But I was relieved.

288
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,680
When I found out you weren't their dog.

289
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:47,680
It's funny, huh?
You're not even mine to begin with.

290
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:53,690
But really,

291
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:57,700
when I found out that I didn't have to part with you,

292
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:03,700
I felt bad for them, but I was happy.

293
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,640
Don't cry.

294
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,640
I ain't crying.

295
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,640
I'll stay with you again.

296
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,640
Listen, I'm the one who's letting you stay.

297
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,650
I love you, Marumo.

298
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,650
Aw, be quiet.

299
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,660
I'm so happy.
So we can live with Mook again, right?

300
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:35,670
-Yeah, we're together again.
-Shaggy hair.

301
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:38,670
Oh, Marumo. Can we take Mook with us on sports day?

302
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:42,670
The printout said no pets allowed.

303
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,680
-Really~.
-We have no choice.

304
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,680
Mook has to stay home.

305
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,680
Okay, then. In preparation for the real deal tomorrow, let's do our final practice.

306
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,690
Get set.

307
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,690
Let's go. 3, 4.

308
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,630
Mook, you're staying home, you know.

309
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:09,630
Besides, that Ai Ai comes much later, huh?

310
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,640
Okay. Nice.

311
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,640
-Nice.
-Nice.

312
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,680
Get set. Ready.

313
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,680
Hey. Over there, over there.

314
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,690
Dad, hurry up.
You made too much bento.

315
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:40,690
What are you talking about.
This is just right.

316
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:43,690
-Hey, we're here. What's up?
-Kaoru's about to run.

317
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,690
Alright. Okay. We made it on time, didn't we?

318
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,700
Oyaji-san, hold these.
And Aya-chan, hold these.

319
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,700
-"Kaoru" "Tomoki"
-What are these?

320
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:56,700
To cheer them on, of course.
Here we go.

321
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,710
Okay. Go, go, let's go.
Let's go Kaoru.

322
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,710
Let's go, let's go.
-Let's go Kaoru!

323
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,710
What are you waiting for?
Come on, Aya-chan, you do it too.

324
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,710
You have to do it too.
Look, do it like this.

325
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,710
Let it fly, Kaoru.

326
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:10,720
-Marumo's awesome.
-He's cool.

327
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,720
Get set. Ready.

328
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,730
Go, go!
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

329
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,670
Okay.

330
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:32,670
Kaoru got 2nd place. Alright, good job.
Next is Tomoki. Tomoki, Tomoki.

331
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,680
Go, go, let's go.
Let's go Tomoki.

332
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,680
Hooray, hooray, Tomoki.
Hooray, hooray, Tomoki.

333
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,680
Go for it, Tomoki. Go for it.

334
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,690
-Okay, Tomoki.
-Okay, Tomoki.

335
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:48,690
Okay, Tomoki. Tomoki...

336
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,690
Takagi-san.

337
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,700
Then get set. Ready.

338
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,660
It's hot. Man, it's hot.

339
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:34,670
Hey, Mamoru, is it okay?

340
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,670
It's okay, it's okay.

341
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:41,680
The first graders' dance is coming up soon.

342
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,680
I can't wait to see them.

343
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,680
I hope Kaoru and Tomoki do well.

344
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,690
I think Kaoru would be fine, but I'm worried about Tomoki.

345
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:53,690
Since that Ai Ai part is difficult.

346
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:57,690
Ah. I hope they're alright.

347
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,700
[I couldn't get their faces

348
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:07,700
out of my mind even after I left them.]

349
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:15,700
[There wasn't a day in the past 4 years that I didn't regret it.]

350
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:21,720
[I hear they're dancing to "Ai Ai" on sports day.]

351
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,650
[I bet Kaoru and Tomoki will be really cute.]

352
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,680
Takagi-san.

353
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,690
Ayumi-san.

354
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:05,690
I'm sorry.

355
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:09,700
I just happened to be passing by.

356
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,700
That sounds pretty lame, doesn't it?

357
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:20,700
We made too much bento.

358
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,650
Oyaji-san and Aya-chan kinda went overboard

359
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:27,650
and made too much.

360
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:31,650
So why don't you stay and eat with us?

361
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,660
We don't want leftovers either.

362
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:38,660
Besides, the more people they have cheering for them,

363
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,660
the happier they'll be.

364
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:49,670
Next we present a dance by the first graders.

365
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:52,670
-Taiga.
-Go, Yuzuki.

366
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,680
-Minami.
-Daichi.

367
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,680
What's he doing?
It's gonna start.

368
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,700
Here you are.
Oh, hello.

369
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:43,660
What's going on with Kaoru-chan?

370
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,660
Maybe she's nervous.

371
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,690
Way to go, Kaoru.

372
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,650
Nice.

373
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,700
Thank you so much for inviting me today.

374
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,700
I had a really good time.

375
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,710
These guys looked like they were having fun too.

376
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:23,710
Remember when Kaoru messed up on her dance

377
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:27,720
you immediately ran up and showed the dance for her?

378
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,720
I thought then that "Ah, he really cares a lot

379
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,720
about the children."

380
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,720
It sounds funny to say this now, but...

381
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:52,740
Mamoru-san, please take care of the children.

382
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,740
Yes, of course.

383
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,690
Hey, you guys. We're almost home.

384
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:11,690
Wake up, wake up, wake up.
Come on, come on.

385
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:13,690
Marumo, I have to pee.

386
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:16,700
What? Wait.
We're gonna run. We're running.

387
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,700
-I can't wait.
-No, hold it in. Hold it in.

388
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,700
Are you awake?

389
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:25,710
Yes. I guess I fell asleep.

390
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,710
It was fun today, wasn't it?

391
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:36,710
Okay, we're here.

392
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,720
Then I'm going now, okay?

393
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,730
Oba-chan.

394
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,730
Yes?

395
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,740
What's the matter?

396
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:06,740
Are you our mommy?

397
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,680
Are you Kaoru and Tomoki's mommy?

398
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,710
No, I'm not.

399
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:43,720
Oh, so you aren't.

400
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,720
I guess I was wrong.

401
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,720
Sorry.

402
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:07,680
Kaoru-chan, eat a lot, laugh a lot and grow, okay?

403
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:13,680
I'll always be rooting for Kaoru-chan and Tomoki-kun.

404
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:18,690
I'm always on your side.

405
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,700
Thanks for today.

406
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,700
Thanks for seeing them home.

407
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:35,700
Kaoru, you say good bye to Oba-chan too.

408
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,700
Oba-chan, thanks for coming today.

409
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,710
Good bye.

410
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:49,720
Take care. Good bye.

411
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:16,680
Man~ That was tiring, huh?

412
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,680
Yeah, but it was fun.

413
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,680
Yeah.

414
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,680
Marumo, your cheers were awesome.
Thanks.

415
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,690
-Thanks.
-Oh, really?

416
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,690
You get energy when someone cheers for you.

417
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:34,700
You do, don't you?
Oh, that's right.

418
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,700
The okite for today.

419
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:55,720
There.

420
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,720
"Let's all..."?

421
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,720
Cheer for each other.

422
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,730
Today you got the strength to push yourself harder because people were cheering for you, right?

423
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,660
Cheering makes people happy, whether you're being cheered, or doing the cheering.

424
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,670
That's so cool. Every day is a sports day.

425
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,670
Yeah, well, something like that.

426
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,670
What is it?

427
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:20,670
-What?
-Did you want to dance too, Mook?

428
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,670
-Maybe so, huh?
-Did you want to see us dance?

429
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,660
What's this?

430
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,670
Sasakura?

431
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,680
[To Ayumi]

432
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,680
[How have you been since?]

433
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:41,690
[You must be surprised to get a letter unexpectedly.]

434
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:45,690
[Sorry. But bear with me for just a little while.]

435
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,700
[After Ayumi left home,

436
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:54,700
I spent my days resenting you for a long time.]

437
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,710
[Things weren't going my way raising the two children,

438
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:02,710
and I couldn't forgive you for abandoning your responsibility as a mother.]

439
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:09,650
[But you were doing this all by yourself, weren't you?]

440
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:13,650
[Yes, all by yourself for 3 long years.]

441
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,660
[Now that I understand how you felt,

442
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:23,660
I couldn't stop myself from writing this letter.]

443
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:26,660
[Thank you for 3 years.]

444
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:32,670
[1 year has passed. Tomoki has a huge appetite

445
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,680
and Kaoru's grown to be a strong child who doesn't cry.

446
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,680
[This watermelon's good, isn't it?]

447
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,680
[If it's at all possible,

448
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,680
I want you to watch Kaoru and Tomoki grow too.

449
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:51,690
[I still consider Ayumi my family.]

450
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:55,690
[Can we all live together again?]

451
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,700
[I want you to stay by Kaoru and Tomoki.]

452
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:05,720
[That's what I wish for the most.]

453
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:11,650
[If you're physically well and when you're mentally ready,

454
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,650
please give me your answer.]

455
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:17,650
[I'll be waiting.]

456
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,650
[From Sasakura Junichirou]

457
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,670
Sasakura.

458
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,650
Takagi-san?

459
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:36,660
Takagi-san?

460
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,660
What are you doing here?

461
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:02,690
This is...

462
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:11,690
Sasakura had already forgiven Ayumi-san long time ago.

463
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,710
Even without me worrying about him,

464
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:24,710
Ayumi-san never stopped being family to him.

465
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,710
It was like that all this time.

466
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:40,730
I knew Sasakura was having a tough time,

467
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:42,730
and I felt so bad for him.

468
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:47,730
That's why I swore

469
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:51,730
I'd never hand over the kids to Ayumi-san, but...

470
00:41:53,740 --> 00:42:00,740
But...but I was wrong.

471
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:08,770
Takagi-san.

472
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:25,710
Aya-chan, I'm going to return them.

473
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,710
What?

474
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:37,720
I'm going to return Kaoru and Tomoki to Ayumi-san.

475
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,720
Wait a minute.

476
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:44,730
Are you going to be okay with that?

477
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:50,730
But you're the one who kept them together.

478
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:54,740
You finally became a family.

479
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,740
I have to do it.

480
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:04,750
Sasakura wrote this with his kids in mind.

481
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:07,750
For his kids' sake.

482
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,680
For these kids' sake.

483
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:24,700
Won't you miss them?

484
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:28,700
Of course I will.

485
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,700
Because they're family.

486
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:39,710
Kaoru and Tomoki are my family.

487
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:48,720
I'll miss them so much, I don't know what I'm going to do.

488
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,730
Then, stay together.

489
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:03,730
But I have to return them.

490
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:09,680
I have to.

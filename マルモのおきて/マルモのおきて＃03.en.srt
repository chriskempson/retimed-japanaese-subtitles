1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
After Daddy died, Kaoru and Tomoki were separated.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,010
But Daddy's friend Marumo

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,010
said we could live with him.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,010
I'm thinking about living with these kids.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,010
Along with a dog called Mook.

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,020
-Can you talk?
-Of course I can.

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,020
We made an Okite* Notebook
(*rules/code)

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,020
so that the three of us can live together happily.

9
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,020
Kaoru and Tomoki will soon be first graders.

10
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:35,030
First time I've had to do two loads of laundry.

11
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,030
Finally done.

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,040
He looks dirty too.

13
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,050
Hey. Hey.

14
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,050
I'll let the dog stay, but he's gotta get washed.

15
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,050
Bring him here.

16
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:00,060
No, no, no, I don't wanna be washed.

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,990
You're going to be living with us so

18
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:07,000
you have to get clean.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,010
I can't take it anymore.

20
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,010
I'm hearing things again.

21
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:23,010
Mook!
Get him, get him, get him.

22
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,020
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Stop!

23
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,030
Look what you've done.

24
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:48,040
I was almost finished too.

25
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,040
You guys...this..

26
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,040
You drew on the poster I made, I didn't you?

27
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,050
-I drew the flowers. Aren't they cute?
-That's too much.。

28
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,050
They shouldn't stand out more than the dog.

29
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,990
And this... this must be Tomoki, huh?

30
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,990
What's this...this picture of seaweed.

31
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,990
-That's Mook.
-I give up.  What a mess.

32
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,000
Oh, dang. It's time.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Hey guys, we're going out.
Hurry up and get ready.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Hurry up, hurry up.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The (school) entrance ceremony will be held on April 6th.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,010
From the following day, they will only
have classes in the morning for a while,

37
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,010
and they will come to school in groups.

38
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,010
The meeting places are noted in this handbook, so

39
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,010
please make sure you verify your location.

40
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,010
Yes, I'll do that.

41
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,030
Um...Excuse me for asking,

42
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,030
but these children aren't your real children, are they?

43
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,030
No, they're my friend's children.

44
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,040
You're not the guardian either.

45
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,040
The children's uncle is their guardian.

46
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,040
I'm just taking care of them.
Is that a problem?

47
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,980
No, no.
Technically, there's no problem, but

48
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:08,990
will you be alright?
There's quite a few school supplies and such that will be needed.

49
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,990
You're right.  There's quite a few.

50
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,990
Oh, and these are the various expenses,

51
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,990
like lunch fees, that you'll have to bear.

52
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,990
These are for one child, so

53
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:22,000
for two children, you'll have to double up everything.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Double?

55
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,010
Supplies to be provided?

56
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:36,010
Apron,
...rags for cleaning, bag for indoor shoes.

57
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:42,020
Wow, we got our work cut out, huh?

58
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:46,020
I will now take roll.
Sasakura Tomoki-san.

59
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,030
-Here.
-Trade places.

60
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:54,030
I will now take roll.
Sasakura Kaoru-san.

61
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,030
Here.

62
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,040
-Are you guys looking forward to school?
-Yeah. I can't wait to be in first grade.

63
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,970
Me too.

64
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,980
Do you guys know what you do at school?

65
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,980
It's not a place you go to play,
it's a play you go to study, you know.

66
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,980
-I want to study.
-Sasakura Kaoru-san,

67
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,980
-don't forget that spirit.
-Yes.

68
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,990
I want to eat the school lunch.

69
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,990
And I want to play with my friends,
and then I want to eat the school lunch.

70
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:22,990
Sasakura Tomoki-san, you eat too much school lunch.
-Yes.

71
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,000
It's exciting, isn't it?

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Oh, and I wanna go look for ransel* too
(*leather backpacks used by Japanese grade schoolers)

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
A black and definitely cool one.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,010
That's right.
We have to buy ransel too.

75
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,010
Will we have just enough time?

76
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,010
-Let's go buy it now.
-Yay.

77
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,010
Alright.
Ransel.  A black one.

78
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,020
-Ransel. Black one.
-Ransel...

79
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,020
45,000 yen?
(approx. $558)

80
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,020
Times 2 is 90,000 yen?

81
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,030
This is our most popular model.

82
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:01,050
-Would you like it?
-Um...give me 5 seconds...

83
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:11,980
I'll take them.  Red and black, one of each.

84
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,980
-With this card.  In installments.
-Thank you very much.

85
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:21,990
Yay, I got a black one.
Yay, I got a black one.

86
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,990
-Kaoru, what's wrong?
-Nothing.

87
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,990
We have other colors too.

88
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:34,000
-Maybe you'd like a different color?
-Kaoru, do you want a different color?

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I want a pink...

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,010
Pink is a very popular color, and it's currently out of stock.

92
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,010
Red's okay then.

93
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:49,010
I'm sorry.
So will red be alright?

94
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:53,020
Kaoru, let's look for a pink one then. Okay?

95
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,020
-Can we?
-Sure. I'll look for it.

96
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,020
Okay, thanks, Marumo.

97
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,960
Oh, excuse me for a moment.

98
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,960
Hello?

99
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,960
What are you doing, Takagi-san?

100
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,970
Oh, I'm shopping for ransel.

101
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,970
-Ransel?
-No, no, I mean...

102
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,970
I have the morning off today.

103
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,970
We have a big problem.

104
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,980
What?

105
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,980
It's this. The Strawberry Glue that went on sale last month.

106
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,980
The stationery glue made to look like strawberry jam.

107
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,980
Oh, the one that's been selling well.
What's the problem?

108
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,980
There's been a rash of children who mistakenly licked it.

109
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,990
The phone's been ringing off the hook with complaints.

110
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,990
Look, it even has seeds,
and there's this scent.

111
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:39,000
-You can't blame them for making a mistake.
-They got us here.

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
-It certainly makes you want to lick it.
-I've had it with

113
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
these complaints about getting sick from eating the whole jar.

114
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
-I bet they're lying.
-But why are we getting these complaints all of a sudden?

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,010
Someone wrote about it on a mother's blog.

116
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,010
So people jumped on the
bandwagon and are making false claims.

117
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,010
Even so, we're still responsible.

118
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,010
We didn't have a cautionary note
on it saying that it should not be consumed.

119
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,010
We didn't?

120
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,020
We should've just stuck to our standard merchandise.

121
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,950
It was out of character for us to try to sell fancy supplies.

122
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,960
I still think it's cute.

123
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,960
Yeah, I thought it was a great idea.

124
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,960
Samejima-san and the managers from PR and Sales

125
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,960
-are going around apologizing to the customers.
-Wow, that's a tough job.

126
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,970
Hello, Customer Service.

127
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,970
Oh, the strawberry glue.
We're very sorry.

128
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,980
Tada~.

129
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,980
Wow, cool.

130
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,990
Looks good on you. That's nice.

131
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,990
What about you, Kaoru-can?
Where's your ransel?

132
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,990
I don't have mine yet.

133
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,990
The store didn't have the one I wanted
so Marumo's going to look for it.

134
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,000
Is that right?  How exciting.

135
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Oh, let me see.

136
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What should I do?

137
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
-Here.
-Thanks.

138
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,010
Are you still taking care of the kids?

139
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,950
Oh, I decided to take them in.

140
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,950
-Take them in?
-Yes.

141
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,950
What, what, what.

142
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:11,960
You mean you're going to be like a foster parent?

143
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,960
That sounds exaggerated, but
I guess that's what it means.

144
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,960
That's not exaggerated.

145
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,960
To take in other people's kids means

146
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,970
that you need to be determined and
responsible, even more than real parents.

147
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,970
I realize that, of course.

148
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,970
You're not gonna get away with it

149
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,970
if you think you can do it half-heartedly, you know.

150
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,980
I know.

151
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,980
Can you really do it?

152
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,980
Hey, your food's here.

153
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,990
My specialty, Kuji Rice.

154
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,990
Oh boy, the kani-san sausage is on top too.
Cute.

155
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,990
Looks good.
Itadakimasu.

156
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,990
-Itadakimasu.
-Okay, eat up.

157
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,990
Itadakimasu.

158
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
-Is it good?
-It's good.

159
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm glad.

160
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,020
Why don't you come for lunch tomorrow too?

161
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,940
I'll make something cute with a sausage for you again.

162
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,940
-Yay.
-Yay.

163
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,950
You come down if anything happens too, okay?

164
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,950
No, that would be imposing on you too much.

165
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,950
Besides, I have readymade stuff for their lunch.

166
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,950
Readymade stuff won't do.
Children have to be

167
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,950
fed properly.
You have to buckle down

168
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,960
-if you're going to be a foster parent.
-I'm sorry.

169
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,960
-What's this?
-Oh this...

170
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,960
It's a list of supplies they need for school.

171
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:32,970
Bag, lunch bag,
apron, cleaning rags, bag for indoor shoes ...

172
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,970
-That's a lot of work to make all these.
-What? I have to make them?

173
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,980
Of course.
Everyone makes them.

174
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,980
Don't make it sound so simple.

175
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,980
I haven't sewn anything since life science class

176
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,980
in grade school.
That would be impossible.

177
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,980
I want Marumo to make mine.

178
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,990
Sasakura Tomoki-san, don't talk when you eating.

179
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,990
Yes.

180
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,990
Impossible. Absolutely impossible. Impossible.

181
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,990
It's too soon for you to get cold feet.

182
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Aya, Aya.

183
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Why don't you help him out.

184
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
-With what?
-You know, you were saying

185
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,010
that lunch bags and stuff are handmade.

186
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,010
Why me?

187
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,010
Because you have the time.

188
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,020
So this was Hatanaka-san's storage room.

189
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,020
He didn't tell you?

190
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,020
Pops just told me not to open the door, so

191
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:30,030
at first I was scared that maybe he was
hiding a corpse or something.

192
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,030
Why would he do something like that.

193
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:40,040
I'm sure Mom's old sewing machine was in here somewhere.

194
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,040
I'm sorry for troubling you.

195
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,040
Huh? Where did it go?

196
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,040
It is here?

197
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:57,050
Oh, here it is.

198
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,060
I wonder if it still works.

199
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You place the fabric here.

200
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
-And bring this to the back.
-Back?

201
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,010
Bring it down. That's right.

202
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:22,010
And you adjust the speed by stepping on the pedal,

203
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:26,020
as you guide the fabric with your hand.
-Guide it.

204
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,020
Ah...H-h-how.

205
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,020
Hey, how do you s-s-stop...

206
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,020
Help!

207
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,030
Lots of kani-san sausages were attacking me

208
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,030
and I couldn't eat all of them.

209
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,030
What kind of dream is he having...

210
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,040
It's a little noisy at night,
so let's just sew by hand.

211
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,040
Sew by hand?

212
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,050
-That's it. Put the needle through one more time.
-Yes.

213
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,050
Yes, that's it.

214
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Finished. Finally.

215
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Huh? Huh?

216
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,010
I give up.

217
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,010
We're very sorry for the inconvenience we caused you.

218
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:12,010
Be careful from now on, will you?

219
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:16,010
They come complaining to us.
Really getting tired of it.

220
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:20,020
For the time being, take these back.

221
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,020
Yes, we're sorry.

222
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:37,030
Stationery supplies are nothing to sneeze at.

223
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:40,030
Gotta cut my expenses where I can.

224
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,040
Takagi-san, what are you doing?

225
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,050
Makimura-san.
I was just...

226
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:54,050
You're thinking about taking some
supplies for your personal use, aren't you?

227
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,050
No, no, no.
Of course, I'll pay for them.

228
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,050
If I cheat like that, it would be
considered corporate embezzlement.

229
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,060
People who do that should be fired.  Fired.

230
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,060
Wow, you're pretty hard-core.

231
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,060
What are you doing here, Makimura-san?

232
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:08,000
Oh, my pen's out of ink.

233
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm embezzling. And cheating.  Don't tell, okay?

234
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:26,020
My pen's out of ink.
I'm embezzling.

235
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,020
And cheating.

236
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,020
Here's the pattern for apron.

237
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,020
Oh, apron.  Thanks.

238
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:37,030
Also, go ahead and use these fabrics.

239
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,030
-I'll give them to you.
-They're cute.

240
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,030
-Aren't they?
-Where did you get them?

241
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,030
I just happened to find some cute fabrics,
so I bought them.

242
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,030
Oh, they're cheap ones
so don't worry about it.

243
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:48,040
Thanks a lot.

244
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,040
Oh, that's right.
I have some school supplies for you guys.

245
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,040
-Let me see.
-Let me see.

246
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,050
Tada~.

247
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:01,050
Pencils, eraser, notebook.

248
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:04,050
What's this. They're not cute at all.

249
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,990
-Huh?
-There's a lot of cute ones out there.

250
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,990
You know, the ones with characters
and glittery and colorful ones.

251
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,990
But these are fine for me.
They're fine for you too, right, Tomoki?

252
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,000
-I want the one with Ultraman.
-These look more

253
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
-grown up and cooler.
-No.

254
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Yeah, these are better.

255
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Oh, look at this.
Tada~.

256
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,010
That's cute.

257
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,010
Stationery glue ala strawberry jam.
It's called just that too - strawberry glue.

258
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:30,010
-It looks so good.
-But you can't eat it.

259
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,010
We're having major problems because of that.

260
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:37,020
This is stationery glue, so you use it to do
things like paste paper, crafts,

261
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,020
-spread it on bread.
Right, spread this all over

262
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,020
lightly toasted bread, and bite into it...
Hey, that's not it.

263
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,030
You're not supposed to do that.

264
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,030
You're not supposed to put it on bread.

265
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:48,030
So you guys sell this kind of things too.

266
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,030
Yes, but this is the only thing geared for children.

267
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,040
Oh speaking of,

268
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,040
have you found Kaoru-chan's ransel yet?

269
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,040
The entrance ceremony's coming up soon, isn't it?

270
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,040
I'm still looking for one, so don't worry. Okay?

271
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,980
Okay, it's bedtime for the munchkins.

272
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,990
If you don't go to bed early, you're not gonna get to be in first grade.

273
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,990
Aren't you going to bed, Marumo?

274
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,990
Not yet.

275
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,990
You're not gonna get to be in first grade.

276
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:19,000
You just worry about yourself.

277
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,020
Should I sleep for a while?

278
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:44,020
Yeah, it'll be more efficient if I take a quick nap

279
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:47,020
and work on it some more after I wake up.

280
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,030
Yeah, let me sleep for a bit.
Just for a little while.

281
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:53,030
I'm just going to lay down.

282
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:58,030
But you're gonna end up sleeping all night, aren't you?

283
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:01,030
Yeah, soundly until morning.

284
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,980
I heard it again.

285
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,980
[In your case,
you may be hearing

286
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,980
what you're feeling in your heart.]

287
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,980
[Your subconscious feeling is taking the form of a voice.]

288
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,990
Yes, you're absolutely right.
Actually, I know that too.

289
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:22,990
I always do this and end up sleeping until the next morning.

290
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,990
Alright, I'm gonna try to go on a little bit longer.

291
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,330
Did you make that yourself?

292
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,330
Huh?
Yeah, I'm trying to cut down on my expenses.

293
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:43,340
-That's really sad.
-Leave me alone.

294
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,340
Hello.

295
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,340
Hello. Why are you here, Makimura-san?

296
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,340
-Is it ready?
-Yes, this is it.

297
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,340
To deal with the issue with the strawberry glue,

298
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,350
we made a poster and stickers with a warning note.

299
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:58,350
Does this mean you want us to go around

300
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,350
the stores putting this sticker on?

301
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,350
Yes, please.

302
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,360
Wait, give me a break!

303
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,360
The past several days we've been going around apologizing

304
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,360
and the phone calls have finally settled down too.

305
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,360
It's okay.
I said we'd do it.

306
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,370
-But Samejima-san...
-What are we going to do with the inventory

307
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,370
if more stock is returned.

308
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:19,370
It's the right course of action for the company.

309
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,370
But is that our job?

310
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:25,380
If the warning note is there,
the customers are less likely to misunderstand,

311
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,380
and as a result,
we'll get fewer complaints and claims.

312
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,380
Even if it's a lot of work now, our department will benefit from it too.

313
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:37,320
Thank you. We'd appreciate it
if you could get it done this week.

314
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,330
I'll go.  I'm going.

315
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:43,330
-Huh? What?
-Mashima, let's go.

316
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,330
What? Huh?
Wait, Takagi-san.

317
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,330
Let's go.

318
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,330
-We're counting on you.
-Yes!

319
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,340
Oyaji-san, you're cruel.

320
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:07,350
Good bye, Mr. Fish.

321
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:10,360
That's why when we eat, we put our hands together

322
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,360
and say itadakimasu.

323
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,360
It means you're going to eat with gratitude.

324
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,360
Mr. Fish, itadakimasu.

325
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,370
It's too early yet.

326
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:24,370
-Tomo-kun, do you want to go for a walk?
-Let's go, let's go.

327
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,370
-Where's Kaoru-chan?
-Come to think of it,

328
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:30,370
she hasn't come back since she went upstairs a while ago.

329
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:54,330
Let me see.  We have language class tomorrow, so I'm studying Japanese.

330
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,340
I have to be able to write hiragana properly.

331
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:04,340
A-I-U-E-O

332
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:08,340
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

333
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,350
How far shall we go?

334
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,360
I want to go to the school.

335
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,360
-Me too.
-Alright, the school it is.

336
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,360
Okay, let's try to remember the way to school then.

337
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:32,370
"When I become a first grader,
when I become a first grader"

338
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:37,310
"Will I make 100 friends?"

339
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,310
I used to walk by this shopping area

340
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:42,310
to attend the same school as you guys, you know.

341
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:45,310
The same one?
Wow.

342
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:53,330
Brings back memories.
This area hasn't changed at all.

343
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,350
[Daddy, when are you going to get better?]

344
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:18,350
[Real soon. Why, I'll be all better before you know it.]

345
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:21,350
[Will you be better by the time I'm start first grade?]

346
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:24,360
[Yes, I'll definitely be better by then.]

347
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,360
[When I get better, let's go buy ransel together, okay?]

348
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,360
[Okay. There's a ransel that I want.]

349
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,380
[It's pink, and it has lots of hearts on it.]

350
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,300
[It's really cute.
That's the ransel I want.]

351
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:41,310
[I definitely want a cool one.]

352
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:44,310
[Okay, got it.  It's a promise.]

353
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:47,310
[Pinky promise then.]

354
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:07,330
What's wrong?

355
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:10,340
Nothing.

356
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,340
What a cute ransel.

357
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,340
It has a lot of hearts.

358
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,350
I hope Marumo-san buys it for you.

359
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,330
You sure threw me off,
acting cool all of a sudden, Takagi-san.

360
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:37,200
-I wasn't doing that.
-That's a lie. You got motivated

361
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
as soon as Makimura-san asked you.

362
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,200
There's a hungry kid who actually
wanted to put this on toast, you know.

363
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,200
It needs a warning note.

364
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,210
Besides, it's an item that's selling well. Right?

365
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:50,210
By the way, how many more stores do we have?

366
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,210
Three more.

367
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:56,210
That many still, huh?

368
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,220
Mashima, I'm going to the restroom.

369
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,220
Takagi-san, the restroom's the other way.

370
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,230
Oh, really?

371
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,240
Ah, found it.

372
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,250
It's pink, and half-price too.

373
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,250
I want this.  I want this no matter what

374
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,250
Takagi-san. What are you doing?

375
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,290
What? Mashima.

376
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,290
Why do you need a ransel?

377
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:41,290
I don't need it. I was just looking at it.

378
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,300
But you were saying "I want it no matter what" just now.

379
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,300
That's because, um, this...

380
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,300
Oh, use it for a shopping bag?

381
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:53,310
Look.  See, the opening is wide, right?

382
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:56,310
So you can put milk and shoyu and all kinds of things in it.

383
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,310
Yeah, it's real practical.
Plus, see?

384
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,310
It frees up your hands, so it's very convenient.

385
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:03,320
It's sturdy and fashionable. Like in Daikanyama*...
(fashionable district in Tokyo)

386
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,320
Everyone in Daikanyama's riding their bicycle

387
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,320
with this on their back.
The reason being, it frees up their hands.

388
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,320
-See, you can wave your hand too.
-I've never seen anything

389
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,320
-like that.
-You've got to look around.  Pay more attention.

390
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,330
Let's do lunch sometime, with this on our back.

391
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,330
-Okay, I'm buying this.
-What?

392
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:18,330
Why does it fit so well.
This is just great.

393
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,330
I finally met you.
Where were you until now.

394
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,330
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

395
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,330
Thank you.

396
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,330
-You know.
-What?

397
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:36,340
Did I ever have reservations about
asking you for something when I was a child?

398
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,340
Nope.
Although there were times

399
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,340
I wished you had reservations.

400
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,350
Right?

401
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:47,350
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
Are you finally feeling bad about it?

402
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:51,350
What are you saying.
I'm talking about Kaoru-chan.

403
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:55,360
She's really careful about holding
back her feelings from Takagi-san.

404
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,360
Well, that can't be helped.

405
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,360
It hasn't been too long since they started living together.

406
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,360
But I feel a little bad for her.

407
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:07,370
Don't go sticking your nose in other people's business, you hear?

408
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:11,370
He has to learn to deal with the kids himself.

409
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,320
Takagi-san, let's get started.
Oh, you already started.

410
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,330
I'm in a panic mode.
I only have until the day after tomorrow.

411
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:34,330
That's admirable.

412
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:39,330
Oh, how cute.
You finally got your ransel.

413
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,330
Look.

414
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,340
[It has a lot of hearts.]

415
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,350
[I hope Marumo-san buys it for you.]

416
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,360
-Thank you, Marumo.
-Yeah.

417
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,360
I'm really looking forward to the entrance ceremony.
Marumo, you have to come too, okay?

418
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,360
Yeah.

419
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:12,370
Seriously, what the heck is Takagi-san doing?

420
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:16,370
He won't even pick up his cell phone.

421
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,370
Is this it?

422
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,340
"We found a lost dog."

423
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,210
What's that guy doing?

424
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:29,220
Excuse me, did you want something?

425
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,220
Oh, um...

426
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:34,220
Takagi Mamoru-san lives up there, doesn't he?

427
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,230
Yes.  Open that door there...

428
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:41,230
I'm Takagi-san's colleague, Mashima Takanori.

429
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,230
Nice to meet you.

430
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:47,230
Ah yes...Nice to meet you.

431
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,250
Cute.

432
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:02,250
Takagi-san, are you sleeping?
Wake up. I'm here to get you.

433
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:08,250
Takagi-san, we have to visit five stores today.

434
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:14,260
This is Takagi-san's house, isn't it?

435
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,260
Yes.

436
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,270
Who are you?

437
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,270
-Who are you, Oji-san?
-Oji-san...

438
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:24,310
Oji-san is...I mean..
I'm actually Onii-san...

439
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,310
My name is Mashima.

440
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,310
Shima-shima?
-What? Not Shima-shima.

441
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:32,310
Mashima...Wait. Hey.

442
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,320
But what's a little girl doing here.

443
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,320
Don't tell me he has a secret child?

444
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,320
Marumo.
Shima-shima's here.

445
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,330
Huh? Shima-shima?

446
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:46,330
Shima-uma (zebra)?
-Shiro-kuma (polar bear)?

447
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,330
What the heck is that.

448
00:27:54,340 --> 00:28:02,340
Mashima.

449
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:07,350
So you took them in?
Both kids?

450
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,350
Yeah.

451
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:12,350
No wonder you were acting weird lately.

452
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:16,350
Yeah. I'm a fool, huh?

453
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,360
I'd say.

454
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:26,350
Where else would you find such a soft-hearted guy.

455
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,310
I'm home.

456
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:04,340
Sasakura Kaoru.

457
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:09,340
...kura Tomoki.

458
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:13,350
...kura Kaoru.

459
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:20,360
Sasakura Tomoru.

460
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,360
Not Tomoru. That won't do.

461
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,300
Okay.

462
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:44,310
Alright, I made it.

463
00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:00,330
What~.

464
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:02,330
Marumo, you can't come to the entrance ceremony?

465
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:07,340
I have lots of work again today.
So I can't come to the entrance ceremony.

466
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:11,340
Come with us, Marumo.
If you don't, you're not gonna get to be in first grade.

467
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,340
You guys being in first grade is good enough.

468
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,340
But.

469
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:19,350
Kaoru, you're the big sister, so you'll be alright, won't you?

470
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,350
I'll be alright.

471
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:25,290
Then you take of Tomoki for me, okay?

472
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,290
-Okay.
-Alright, go on then.

473
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:36,300
We're going.

474
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,300
Have fun.

475
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,300
Don't you have to go?

476
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,310
It's the entrance ceremony, isn't it?

477
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:55,320
I don't have time for that right now.

478
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,320
I don't have a choice.

479
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
We're done with the stickers.
Again, we apologize.

480
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
-We're sorry.
-Please be more careful.

481
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,010
Where to next?
The Home Center.

482
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:14,010
-I bet they have a lot.
-It might take a while.

483
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:17,010
Can we just come in without permission?

484
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:19,010
They don't have enough space right now.

485
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,020
And there's gonna be three of them from now on.

486
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:25,020
Oh, you're home by yourself?
Good boy.

487
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:31,030
Mook?
What do you have there?

488
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:34,030
What?
Bag for indoor shoes?

489
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:38,030
They should have taken their indoor shoes today...

490
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:41,030
He must have forgotten them.

491
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,990
Excuse me.

492
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:03,990
Oh, sure.

493
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,990
-Hello.
-Takagi-san?

494
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:10,000
Today's the kids' entrance ceremony, isn't it?

495
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
-Yes.
-Did you forget their indoor shoes?

496
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,010
Indoor shoes? I'm not sure.

497
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:22,010
What do you mean you're not sure.
Where are you now?

498
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:24,010
Aren't you at the school?

499
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:26,010
I'm at work.

500
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,020
Work?

501
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,020
This is the entrance ceremony, you know?
Why didn't you go?

502
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,020
There's been some trouble at work,

503
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,020
so at a time like this

504
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,030
how can I say "Let me attend the entrance ceremony"?

505
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:40,030
Everyone else is working.

506
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:42,030
I can't believe it.

507
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:45,030
Children's entrance ceremony takes precedence for normal people.

508
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:47,040
Those poor kids.

509
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:51,040
Don't act like you know it all when you don't know anything.

510
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:55,040
Tomoki was a little disappointed, but Kaoru understood.

511
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,050
You're the one who doesn't know anything, Takagi-san.

512
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,980
What?

513
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:04,990
Kaoru-chan's desperately trying to hold it in.

514
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:08,990
I'm the one who was desperately trying to get everything ready for them.

515
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,990
What does Kaoru have to hold in?

516
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,990
Things like desks and cute stationery...

517
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:15,000
The things every child wants.

518
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And the ransel too.

519
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I did buy her one.
The pink one that she wanted.

520
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:27,010
What she really wanted was the ransel with the hearts.

521
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:29,010
Hearts?

522
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:31,010
I can't buy

523
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,010
everything the children wants.

524
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:38,020
Besides, she never told me anything about hearts on the ransel.

525
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:42,020
She couldn't tell you because she didn't want to impose on you.

526
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,030
Huh?

527
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:47,030
Children normally won't hesitate to say it

528
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,030
If even they know they won't get it, to be able to say

529
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:52,030
"I want it" - that's what kids do, right?

530
00:33:54,040 --> 00:34:01,040
But she held it in and couldn't tell you.

531
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:06,980
[I want the pink...]

532
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,980
[What's wrong?]

533
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,980
[Nothing.]

534
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:14,990
[-Thanks, Marumo
-Yeah.]

535
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:17,990
[I'm really looking forward to the entrance ceremony.]

536
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,010
[They're not cute at all.
There's a lot of cute ones out there.]

537
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:36,010
[You know, the ones with characters
and glittery and colorful ones.]

538
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:39,010
[But these are fine for me.
They're fine for you too, right, Tomoki?]

539
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:44,020
[Kaoru, you're the big sister, so you'll be alright, won't you?]

540
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:47,020
[-Okay.
-Alright, go on then.]

541
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,970
Both of them

542
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,980
were practicing their answer over and over

543
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,980
for when their name was called.

544
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,980
[-Sasakura Tomoki-san.
-Here.]

545
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,980
[-Sasakura Kaoru-san.
-Here.]

546
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,990
[-Sasakura Tomoki-san.
-Here.]

547
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:21,990
[-Sasakura Kaoru-san.
-Here.]

548
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:24,990
[Hey, how many times are you going to practice?]

549
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:28,000
[As many times as we can.
We're gonna answer real loud

550
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
so that Marumo can hear us.]

551
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
[-Sasakura Kaoru-san.
-Here.]

552
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:48,020
Takagi-san, is something the matter?

553
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:52,020
Today's the kids' entrance ceremony.

554
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:59,030
Yeah, it is.

555
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:05,970
I swore to myself that I'd watch over them

556
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,970
in Sasakura's place.

557
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:12,970
But I wasn't watching them.

558
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:20,980
I wasn't watching over them like I should have been.

559
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:28,990
Can't you still make it?

560
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,000
Sorry.

561
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,010
We will now call out the names of the new students.

562
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:47,010
When your name is called,

563
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:50,010
please stand up and answer loud and clear.

564
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:56,020
-Asakawa Daichi-san.
-Here.

565
00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:00,040

566
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,040

567
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,960

568
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,960

569
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:18,970

570
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:22,980

572
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,990
-Tezuka Minami-san.
-Here.

573
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:38,990
-Look, Marumo's here.
-No way.

574
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,990
-Koizumi Taiga-san.
-Here.

575
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,010
-Kogure Aoi.
-Here.

576
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:56,010
-Saitou Subaru-san.
-Here.

577
00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:00,950
-Sasakura Kaoru-san.
-Here.

578
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:04,950
-Sasakura Tomoki-san.
-He~re.

579
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,960
-Shiina Mio-san.
-Here.

580
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,970
-Taniguchi Hayato-san.
-Here.

581
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:21,970
-Togami Genki-san.
-Here.

582
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:25,970
-Nakamoto Yuzuki-san.
-Here.

583
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,980
-Hirose Hibiki-san.
-Here.

584
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,980
-Machida Haruka-san.
-Here.

585
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:07,940
The 24 new students of Hirokawa Elementary of 2011.

586
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,960
Marumo!
Marumo.

587
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,960
Marumo.
Marumo, Marumo.

588
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,960
Marumo, you came.
Thank you.

589
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:29,970
Um..Sorry.  Anyway, sorry.
For saying I couldn't come.

590
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:31,970
We didn't think you were coming.

591
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,980
The bag that Marumo made for me,

592
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,980
my friend said it's cute.

593
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,980
-This bag too.
-Is that right?

594
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,980
I answered loudly too.

595
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:45,990
You know, Tomoki's cracked.
He said "He~re."

596
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:48,990
-I got nervous.
-Were you watching, Marumo?

597
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:51,990
I was watching.  I watched very carefully.

598
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Okay, let's get going.

599
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,940
Hey, shall we take a picture too?

600
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,950
Excuse me.
Excuse me, but

601
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,950
-can I ask you to take our picture?
-Sure.

602
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,950
Thanks.
It's all set up to go.

603
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,960
-Oh, Mook's here.
-Mook.

604
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,960
What? Why is he here?

605
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,970
You're taking a picture, aren't you? Don't forget about me.

606
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,970
-What? Did he talk?
-Are you ready?

607
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,980
Did you perhaps cry?

608
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,980
No, I didn't. What? Again.

609
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:47,980
-Excuse me, are you ready?
-Yes, please.

610
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,980
Sit.

611
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,990
Here we go.

612
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:15,010
"We're in first grade now"

613
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:19,010
-"We have 100 friends now"
-You guys lie.

614
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:22,020
Be careful now.

615
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:25,020
Your head. See, what did I just say.

616
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:35,030
-You're home.
-Hi, welcome home.

617
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:39,030
-Hi.
-Hi.

618
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:42,040
Huh?

619
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,040
What's this.

620
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,040
-It's a desk.
-Wow!

621
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:50,040
That's my hand-me-down, but
it's a present to celebrate your admission to school.

622
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,050
-Alright!
-Thank you.

623
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:55,050
I'm not using this storage room anyway,

624
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:57,050
-so do what you want with it.
-You really mean it?

625
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:00,990
Thank you very much.

626
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:02,990
-Let's sit down.
-Let's study.

627
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:04,990
Let's study.

628
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,990
Look, a pencil sharpener.
Yeah.

629
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
-Everyone, gather around.
-What?

630
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
It's a new okite.

631
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:24,010
Oh, you can't read it, can you.

632
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:33,020
Enryo* is...? (*to hold back)

633
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:37,020
Enryo wa muyou*
(unnecessary)

634
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:40,030
-What's that?
-We're a family, so

635
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:42,030
we should say whatever's on our mind.

636
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:46,030
If there's something you want, say so.
It means it's okay to do that.

637
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,040
Okay, Kaoru?

638
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,040
-Okay, Marumo, I want ice cream.
-You just had one.

639
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,040
But I want another one.
Didn't you say enryo wa muryou?

640
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,040
It's muyou, not muryou*.
(*free)

641
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,050
That doesn't mean you're going to get everything you ask for.

642
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:00,980
Ice cream's gonna attack you.
What are you going to do?

643
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:29,010
-Good morning.
-Morning.

644
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:37,020
Oh, it's a heart.

645
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:40,020
Well, I couldn't buy you the ransel with hearts, but

646
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,020
that's a heart too, right?

647
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,030
That's so tacky~.

648
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:46,030
What?

649
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:50,030
It's cute.  Thanks, Marumo.

650
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:56,040
Oh, it's an onigiri.  It looks yummy.

651
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,040
No, I tell you, it's tacky.

652
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,980
-Why? It's cute.
-It looks yummy

653
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,980
No, no, it's definitely tacky.

654
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:05,980
-I say it's cute.
-I say it's yummy.

655
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,980
I say it's tacky.

656
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,990
You're kidding me? Did he just talk?

657
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:12,990
-Were you talking with the dog?
-What?

658
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:16,990
I mean, the dog's voice is really the voice of my heart,

659
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:18,990
and he's actually not really talking, and...

660
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,000
What? Why?
What? Why are you talking?

661
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
-He talks.
-He talks.

662
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
-I talk.
-What~? Why?

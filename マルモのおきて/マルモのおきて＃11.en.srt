1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,970
Kaoru, Tomoki. It's morning~.

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,970
Oh, you scared me.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,970
Wake up. Hey.

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,970
-You guys sleep too much.
-Marumo, it's early and already you're so full of energy.

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,980
I'm always full of energy.
Come on, wake up and

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,980
get ready.

7
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,980
Tomoki, we're going.

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,980
-Gochisousama.
-Let's go.

9
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,990
-See you later.
-See you later.

10
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,990
Okay.
Be careful. See you later.

11
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:36,000
[Sasakura had already

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
forgiven Ayumi-san long time ago.]

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
[I'm going to return Kaoru and Tomoki to Ayumi-san.]

14
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,020
I'm back.

15
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,960
Takagi-san, the phone's ringing.
Takagi-san?

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,960
Huh? Oh.

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,960
What are you doing daydreaming?

18
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,960
Sorry.

19
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,970
Takagi-kun, maybe you're a little tired?

20
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,970
You have to take a break once in a while.
Raising kids wears you out, doesn't it?

21
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,970
Well, yes.

22
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,980
Takagi, can you come out for a while?

23
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:27,980
Ah...um. I'll be right there.

24
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,980
So, have you gotten used to this job?

25
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,990
Yes, I'm managing somehow.

26
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,990
Handling complaints must be a tough job.

27
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,990
What brings you here all of a sudden?

28
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,990
You've heard from Samejima-san, haven't you?

29
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,000
Yes, I heard.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So, do you think you might want to return to the Product Development Department?

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Well...

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You know, that ear cleaner pen.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,010
Our department doesn't have anyone
who can come up with ideas like that right now.

34
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,010
Come back and do what you want to do again.

35
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,010
I personally think highly of your ideas.

36
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,950
Thank you.

37
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,950
Samejima-san, who's that person Takagi-san just went out with?

38
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,960
Ah, Umehara-kun from Product Development.
He's Takagi-kun's former boss.

39
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,960
-Finally, huh?
-Finally?

40
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,960
His return to Product Development.

41
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,970
Looks like Kake-Run-Run's getting favorable reviews there too.

42
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,970
Oh, Takagi-san,

43
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,970
-congratulations.
-Huh? What are you talking about?

44
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,970
Don't play dumb.
You got good news, didn't you?

45
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,980
No, nothing's been decided yet.

46
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,980
There you go again.
There's no reason for you to decline.

47
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,980
Well, no.

48
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,980
What are you going to do about the twins?

49
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,990
You may have to work a lot of overtime at Product Development.

50
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,990
There are things like after-school care
so you'll figure something out.

51
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,990
You're going to be busy, Takagi-kun.

52
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,990
About that...

53
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm thinking of

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
returning the twins to their mother.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What? You're going to return them?

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,010
Yes, some things happened that made me decide.

57
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:05,950
You did well, working in an unfamiliar department while raising the kids.

58
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,950
Takagi-san, it's so sudden, are you going to be alright?

59
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,950
I'm fine, just fine.
There won't be any problems with overtime or anything anymore.

60
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,960
But if Takagi-san leaves,

61
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,960
-it's going to be quiet around here.
-We'll certainly

62
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,960
miss you.

63
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:24,960
But it's a great opportunity.
We'll all be rooting for you.

64
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,970
Huh? What's this?

65
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,970
I'm thinking about going to an onsen*.
(*hot spring resort)

66
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,970
-Why all of a sudden?
-Huh? Is it all of a sudden?

67
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,980
Never mind that.
I just feel like it.

68
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,980
Grown-ups need a break once in a while.

69
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,980
Right?

70
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,980
Surprisingly, kids need breaks too.

71
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,990
Kids don't need any.
But I'll let you come with me.

72
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,990
Yay.
Yay, Yay.

73
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,990
-Yay.
-Onsen, onsen.

74
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,000
Yay, yay.

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

76
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,940
I'm planning to take the kids to an onsen over the weekend.

77
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,950
It's the first and last family trip.

78
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,950
What do you mean by last?

79
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,950
Oyaji-san.

80
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:27,960
I decided to return Kaoru and Tomoki to their mother.

81
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,960
You thought about it carefully, right?

82
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,960
Yes.

83
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,970
And what did they say?

84
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:43,980
I haven't told them yet.
But I'm sure they'll understand.

85
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,980
Will they really?

86
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,990
I don't think they'll be able to accept being told something like that all of a sudden.

87
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,990
After all, even though it was only for a short time,

88
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,990
you spent time together as a family.

89
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,990
How can you tell them to go to their mother all of a sudden.

90
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:09,940
But I think that's the best thing for them.

91
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,940
They'll have to accept it.

92
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,940
I see.

93
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:22,950
But you have to consider their feelings too.
You understand that, don't you?

94
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,950
Yes, I know.

95
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,960
You guys better rush.
We're barely gonna make the train.

96
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,960
Baggage okay, camera okay.

97
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,960
Twins okay, Mook okay.
Okay, okay, okay. Let's go.

98
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,970
Oh, Marumo. We left the laundry drying outside.

99
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,970
Ah~
Oh well, just leave it. Let's go.

100
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,970
Stop. Mook, stop.
Stop. Wait a minute.

101
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,980
Stop.
Tomoki, what's in here?

102
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,980
-Things I need for the trip.
-Marumo, we're gonna miss the train.

103
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,980
Let's go.

104
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,980
Yay.
We're here, we're here.

105
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,990
Okay, we're here.

106
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,920
Yay.
Onsen.

107
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,920
-Onsen, onsen.
-Okay, let's go.

108
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,930
Okay, here we go.
Give me a smile. Say cheese.

109
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,930
Here we go, Marumo.
Say cheese.

110
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,940
Wow, awesome.

111
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,960
Mook.

112
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,960
I wanna go in too.

113
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,960
-That's terrible.
-That's cruel.

114
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,970
What are you talking about?
This is as extravagant as you can get.

115
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,970
Here we go.

116
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,970
Smile, smile.
Say cheese.

117
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,980
Fish is much fresher here in Izu, isn't it?

118
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,980
It's same as usual anyway.

119
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,000
You haven't had abalone before, have you?

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,920
It's like it's still alive. Look.
Like it's still alive.

121
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,920
-What happened?
-Oh, no, it's nothing.

122
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,930
It was, what you might say, good enough to scream.

123
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:17,930
-No! No!
-I wanna eat sashimi too.

124
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,930
Everything's delicious.
No, Mook. No way. Hey.

125
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,930
M-Mook. Mook.
Stop, hey, hey.

126
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,950
Wait, wait a sec. Look.

127
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,960
Mook-san, why are you mad?

128
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,960
I don't get to do anything, all I get is dog food.

129
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,960
We're very sorry.

130
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,960
Forget it. I'm going to sleep.

131
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,970
Aw~. He's pouting.

132
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,920
Huh?

133
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,920
What's wrong?
Do you have to go bathroom?

134
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,920
Something's there.

135
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,920
What?

136
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,930
Is it a ghost?

137
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,930
No, there's no way.

138
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,930
Hey, it's, it's alright.
It's alright, I think.

139
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,940
I'm scared.
I'm scared, I'm scared.

140
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:36,940
I'm gonna open it. Here it goes.

141
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,960
You. What are you doing?

142
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,980
I was kinda starving to death.

143
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,900
My snack.

144
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,920
Ghost! It's a ghost!

145
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,920
Ah~ you scared me.

146
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,920
I heard a scream so...

147
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,920
-What happened?
-Well, the kids

148
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,930
said there's a ghost here.
-I'm sorry.

149
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,930
Oh, please.
Don't talk about ghosts.

150
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,930
Don't worry.
Ghosts won't appear in this room.

151
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:36,940
In this room? Huh?
-Wha-what? What about the others?

152
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,940
Others? Do they appear in other rooms?

153
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,940
Let's just go to sleep for now.
Sleep, sleep.

154
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,940
I'm scared. It's scary, scary, scary, scary
scary, scary, scary.

155
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,950
Can we sleep with you?

156
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,950
What? Hey, wait.

157
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,950
Alright, come on.

158
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,960
Feels nice.

159
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,970
Marumo, get that water over there.

160
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,970
No, it's hot.

161
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,980
It must feel good, huh?

162
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,980
Good luck.

163
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,990
Mook, wait. You wait here.

164
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,010
May all of us come to onsen again next year.

165
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:51,010
May we eat sashimi again.

166
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:58,010
May the two of them always stay healthy.

167
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,960
Oh, this is cute.

168
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,960
Okay, I'll buy you one then.

169
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,960
-Really?
-Yeah.

170
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,960
That bell's a charm against evil spirits.

171
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,960
If you carry that,
you won't be scared of ghosts anymore.

172
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,970
You can sleep alone anywhere.

173
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,970
"Who's scared of ghosts.
There's no such thing as ghosts."

174
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,980
"Someone half asleep must have made a mistake."

175
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,980
"But just a little,
just a little"

176
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,980
"I'm scared too."

177
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,980
We're home.

178
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,980
-We're back.
-We're back.

179
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,990
It's nice to be home, huh?

180
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,990
Marumo, can I take out the presents?

181
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:46,000
You can look at them, but don't open them, okay?

182
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Oh, the laundry.

183
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,010
Not again.

184
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,950
I'm not buying anymore, you know.

185
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,970
-This is mine.
-This is Aya-chan's.

186
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:27,970
-This is mine.
-This is Oyaji-san's.

187
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:32,980
Really, home is the best.

188
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,950
Sorry for calling you out on short notice.

189
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,950
Did something happen to the children?

190
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,950
No, the kids are fine.

191
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:34,960
I wanted to give this to you today.

192
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:40,960
Sasakura had it.
It was stashed away with some old pictures.

193
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,970
I'm sorry.
I read it without your permission.

194
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:00,990
[If it's at all possible, I want you to watch

195
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,990
Kaoru and Tomoki grow too.]

196
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:08,000
[I still consider Ayumi my family.]

197
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,940
[Can we all live together again?]

198
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,940
[I want you to stay by Kaoru and Tomoki.]

199
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,940
[That's what I wish for the most.]

200
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:24,940
Sasakura was waiting for Ayumi-san.

201
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,950
I made up my mind after I read that.

202
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,960
I'm returning Kaoru and Tomoki to you.

203
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,970
If that's how Sasakura felt,

204
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:45,970
I think Kaoru and Tomoki should live with you.

205
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,970
But...

206
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,980
To tell you the truth,

207
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,980
I want to keep on watching over them.

208
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:03,990
That was my intention when I took them in,
and that's how I lived with them.

209
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,990
I thought that was the thing to do.

210
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,930
But I decided to return them.

211
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,940
Are you sure?

212
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:32,950
Ayumi-san, Sasakura was carefully holding on to that letter.

213
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,950
Without throwing it away all this time.

214
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:41,950
Now that I know how he felt,
I have no choice but to return them.

215
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,960
Kaoru and Tomoki should live with Ayumi-san.

216
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:59,980
Mook-san,
how is the water temperature?

217
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,980
Shall I scrub your back?

218
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,980
Can we quit this game?
I'm tired of it.

219
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,920
Onee-chan, Marumo's late, huh?
Where did he go?

220
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,930
I don't know.
He said he had some important business.

221
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,930
I'm back. Both of you here?

222
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,930
Oh, Marumo's home.

223
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,930
-Welcome home.
-Welcome home.

224
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,940
Oh, Oba-chan's here too.

225
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,940
-Hello.
-Did you come for a visit?

226
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:34,940
Oba-chan, I'll show you our room. Come this way. Over here, over here.

227
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,950
You guys, do that later.
Come sit here.

228
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,950
But we wanna play.

229
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,950
You can play all you want later on,
so just wait a while.

230
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,950
-Okay?
-Alright.

231
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,960
Ayumi-san, please sit here.

232
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,960
You guys sit there.

233
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:00,970
I have something important to tell you.

234
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,970
Listen until I finish, okay?

235
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,910
-Mommy?
-Yeah.

236
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:15,920
That's a picture of your mommy.

237
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,920
I still think they look alike.
She looks like Oba-chan.

238
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:28,930
About that, Kaoru.
I lied.

239
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:35,940
The truth is, just like Kaoru said,
this oba-chan,

240
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:41,940
Ayumi-san, is your mommy.

241
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,950
What?

242
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,950
I'm sorry.

243
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,950
But Oba-chan said "No, I'm not."

244
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:54,960
Daddy said Mommy died too.

245
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,960
They were lies too.

246
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:07,970
Then where were you all this time, Oba-chan?

247
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:15,910
Mommy ran away from you two.

248
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,910
Why?
Because we were bad?

249
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:22,920
No.
Because I was a bad mommy,

250
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:28,920
I ran away from you and I was hiding all this time.

251
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:33,930
I missed not having a mommy.

252
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:36,930
Why didn't you come see us?

253
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,940
Why didn't you come when Daddy died too?

254
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,940
Listen, guys. Ayumi-san...

255
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,940
Abandoned us, right?

256
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,950
That's why you kept it from us. Liar.

257
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:54,950
Hey, Kaoru, Tomoki.
Hey, wait.

258
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,950
Marumo's a liar.
Liar.

259
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,950
Hey, Kaoru, Tomoki.

260
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,960
What happened?

261
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,960
I told them the truth.

262
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,960
Then they...

263
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:17,900
That's why we told you.
That you have to consider their feelings too.

264
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,910
I'll go.

265
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,980
They're confused right now, but

266
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,980
I'll talk to them so they'd understand.

267
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,980
I'm sure they'll understand.

268
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:43,990
I know what I did can't be forgiven.

269
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,990
-I know that.
-That's not true.

270
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:53,000
But I'm glad I got to tell them.

271
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I'm glad I got to apologize to them.

272
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,010
Mamoru-san, thank you.

273
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:06,010
No, everything will be fine.
I'll make sure they understand.

274
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,970
What are you doing?

275
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,970
Aya-chan.

276
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,970
Is there something on your mind?

277
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:40,980
Yes. They're saying Oba-chan isn't Oba-chan

278
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,980
and that she's our real mommy.

279
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,990
You must have been surprised, huh?

280
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,990
Yes.

281
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:53,990
Aya-chan.

282
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:57,000
Yes?

283
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I wonder why Oba-chan abandoned us.

284
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Is it because she didn't like us?

285
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,010
If she didn't like you,
she wouldn't have come to see you again.

286
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:12,010
I don't think she abandoned you.

287
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,010
But everyone lied and kept it from us.

288
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:17,020
Marumo was lying too.

289
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,020
If you liked someone,
you wouldn't lie, would you?

290
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:24,020
It's bad to lie.

291
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:30,020
Yes, lying is bad.
I think so too.

292
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:37,970
But I think everyone had to try hard to lie to you because they love you.

293
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,970
That's weird, to have to try hard to lie.

294
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,970
If you found out,

295
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,980
you might not like them anymore, right?

296
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:51,980
But even then, they had to keep on lying to you.

297
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,990
Just think, they're lying to their loved ones.

298
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:01,990
Don't you think they had a very good reason?

299
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Now that you know they were lying, do you dislike them now?

300
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Really? I'm glad.

301
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:23,010
Let's go home.
Marumo-san was worried.

302
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,960
-I'm home.
-I'm home.

303
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,960
Oh, hi.

304
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:45,970
-Where's Ayumi-san?
-She left a little while ago.

305
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:50,980
Both of them have calmed down, but

306
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,980
they're still a little confused.

307
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:58,980
Thank you very much.
You've been a big help.

308
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:04,980
Um...Do you really have to return them?

309
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,990
I know it's going to be

310
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,000
the hardest on you, but...

311
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Even so, I'm going to miss them.

312
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,010
I enjoyed the time I spent with the three of you, and

313
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:28,010
and I realized how wonderful a family is by watching you guys.

314
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:53,970
Do you think those  guys will come to accept it?

315
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,980
What about you?

316
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,980
Are you going to be able to accept it?

317
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:17,000
When Ayumi-san first appeared,

318
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
somewhere in my mind I already knew.

319
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
That I should return those two.

320
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Because she's their mother.

321
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,940
I see.

322
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:41,950
I don't really want to part with them.

323
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,960
I want to stay with them from now on too.

324
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,960
Ah~. How I wish I hadn't read that letter.

325
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:13,990
I'll miss them,

326
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:17,990
but now that I read it, I have no choice but to return them.

327
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:24,990
I have to convince myself.

328
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,930
It's sad, isn't it?

329
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:38,940
After all, you started out as total strangers and became a family.

330
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,950
But you did well.

331
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,950
You really did.

332
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,950
I'm impressed.

333
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:03,950
I'm coming, Mommy.

334
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,970
Tomorou, are you alright?

336
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,970
Kaoru-chan.

337
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:20,970
[You're alright now.
You were startled, weren't you?]

338
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,980
-Are you hurt?
-I'm okay.

339
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,980
Onee-chan, what's wrong?

340
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,990
Tomoki, what did you think when you found out that

341
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,990
-Oba-chan's our mommy?
-I don't know.

342
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:37,990
I was so surprised, I didn't know what to think.

343
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:41,000
How about you, Onee-chan?

344
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I don't know either.

345
00:26:56,030 --> 00:27:00,030
-I'm back.
-Welcome home.

346
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:06,950
Kaoru, Tomoki. Do you have a minute?

347
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,960
I'm going to write an okite.

348
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,970
Okite? The okite for today?

349
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:20,970
Yeah, watch carefully.

350
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,980
-Aren't you writing?
-Marumo?

351
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,980
I'm writing now.

352
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,940
We're family, even if we're apart.

353
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,940
Apart?

354
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,940
Marumo, why are you writing such an okite?

355
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,940
Are we going to be apart?

356
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,950
Because we fought?

357
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,950
Marumo, I'm sorry for calling you a liar.

358
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:16,960
I won't say it anymore.
So let's stay together.

359
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,960
Huh, Marumo?

360
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,960
I wanna be with Marumo.
Let's always stay together.

361
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,970
I don't want us to be apart.

362
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,970
Marumo.

363
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,980
You look pathetic.

364
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,980
What's with that "Marumo." Seriously.

365
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:45,990
-But...
-Listen. People grow up.

366
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,990
In the future, Kaoru will grow up to be a gal,

367
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:52,990
Tomoki will grow up to be a cool dude.
Then

368
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:56,010
you guys won't be needing this dinky house, would you?

369
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,930
You'd be sick and tired of this messy place.

370
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:59,930
That's not true.

371
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,940
That's why you should get out of here ahead of time.

372
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,940
You'll be sad and lonely now,
but forget about it right away.

373
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,940
I've made up my mind.

374
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,950
But Kaoru and Tomoki don't have a place to live.

375
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,950
If we don't have Marumo,
we won't have a place to sleep.

376
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,950
So let's stay together.

377
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:19,950
If Marumo doesn't fix our meals,
we'll get hungry. So...

378
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,950
You have your mommy, don't you?

379
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,960
You're going to live with your mommy.

380
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,970
-Mommy?
-Yeah.

381
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,970
Your mommy didn't abandon you.

382
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:36,970
Your mommy was sick all this time.

383
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:40,980
She was battling her illness all by herself.

384
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:48,980
Your daddy was rooting for your mommy as he was taking care of you guys.

385
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:53,990
He lied when he said she died to hide her illness from you.

386
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:57,930
But your mommy's well now.

387
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:02,930
That's why you're going back to her.

388
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:06,930
That's what your daddy wanted too.

389
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:12,940
-I don't wanna.
-Crying's not gonna work.

390
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,940
You're going to your mommy.

391
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,950
I don't care if I don't have a mommy.

392
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,950
If we have to be separated from Marumo,

393
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,950
-I don't need a mommy.
-Tomoki.

394
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:31,960
Do you know how much your mommy loves you guys?

395
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,960
She loved you, and loved you...

396
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,960
she loved you so much that her heart got sick.

397
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,970
Even then...
Even then, because she wanted to see you guys,

398
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:44,970
she got better all by herself,
and returned as your healthy mommy.

399
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:51,980
Don't ever say that you don't need your mommy.

400
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:56,000
Don't ever say you don't need your family.

401
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,920
But I'm never gonna accept it.
I don't care about any okite.

402
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,930
Hey, Tomoki.

403
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,930
Hey, can't you abide by the okite?

404
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:11,930
Hey. Don't you know that's our family's valuable okite?

405
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,920
What's the matter, Mook?

406
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:19,930
[Think of it as our promise so that we can live in harmony

407
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:21,930
from now on.]

408
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:28,940
[We're family, so say what we want to each other.]

409
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,940
[It's okay to do so, that's what it means.]

410
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:43,960
[A family stamp.
See, everyone's together, right?]

411
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,930
Tomoki.

412
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:25,930
Onee-chan, is Marumo mad?

413
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:29,940
I wonder if he's mad because I tore the Okite Notebook.

414
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,940
I don't know. He's not home yet.

415
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:42,950
I don't want to be separated from Marumo.
I want to be with him.

416
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:46,950
Onee-chan too, right?

417
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:50,950
Onee-chan, you don't mind being separated?

418
00:33:53,960 --> 00:34:00,900
I do, but there's no exception to Marumo's okite.

419
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,900
Hey, I bought some ice cream,
Kaoru, Tomo...

420
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:08,910
We can't break the okite Marumo made.

421
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,910
It's the family's okite.

422
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:13,910
But today's okite is wrong.

423
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:21,920
Marumo's okite was never wrong.

424
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,930
Daddy died and isn't here anymore, but

425
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:28,930
we're not lonely anymore, are we?

426
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:34,940
We get along with Aya-chan and Oyaji-san and

427
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,940
our friends at school, right?

428
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:43,940
That's because Marumo wrote the okite for us.

429
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,950
That's what I think.

430
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:49,950
Okite...

431
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:54,960
If we're separated from Marumo, he won't be writing okite for us anymore, huh?

432
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,890
He won't be writing them anymore.

433
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:02,900
But we have to try our best.

434
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:08,900
Let's abide by the last okite too
and get praised by Marumo.

435
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:15,910
Let's say bye bye to Marumo with a smile.

436
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:44,930
Oh, but I hope Mommy doesn't get sick again.

437
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,940
Your mommy won't get sick again.

438
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:01,960
The 4 years she was apart from you,

439
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,960
your mommy never stopped thinking about you guys.

440
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:10,970
Wasn't that castella she brought for your birthday delicious?

441
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:12,970
How can she make

442
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:16,970
something that delicious if she didn't cherish you guys.

443
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:21,980
Do you still think that your mommy will get sick again?

444
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:26,980
She was watching over you guys on sports day too.

445
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:30,990
A mommy like that won't get sick again.

446
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:36,990
Even when you were apart, you guys and your mommy were always family.

447
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:41,000
We are too.

448
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Even if we're separated from now on,
we're family even if we're apart.

449
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:53,010
But even if we're family, it's sad to be apart.

450
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:56,030
Don't say such a thing.

451
00:36:56,030 --> 00:37:01,030
We were able to become a real family in such a short time.

452
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:05,950
There's no need to be sad.

453
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:08,950
Because you guys and I will be family for the rest of our lives.

454
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,960
Am I wrong, Kaoru?
We're family, aren't we?

455
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,970
Yes.

456
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:23,970
Tomoki, we're a real family, aren't we?

457
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:26,970
-Yes.
-We're family.

458
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:33,980
That doesn't change no matter where we go,

459
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,980
no matter if we're apart.

460
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,980
Marumo.

461
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Marumo.

462
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,970
What is it?

463
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:58,840
Did you buy ice cream?

464
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:05,850
Are you kidding, at a time like this?

465
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,850
Shall we eat together?

466
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:15,860
It's melting.

467
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,860
That's okay. Ice cream's good when it's like this.

468
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:35,970
Gosh, it's way too late.
What, did everyone already leave?

469
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:38,970
That's cold.

470
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:41,980
I'm back, but one's around to hear me.

471
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:45,980
Wah!
-Takagi-kun, congratulations!

472
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,980
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

473
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,980
Congratulations.

474
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,990
-What, a farewell party?
-Were you surprised?

475
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:54,990
It's a surprise to celebrate your reassignment.
Come over here.

476
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:56,990
I'll propose a toast.

477
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,990
Wait, wait, wait.
Hey, wait.

478
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Alright, everyone, in celebration of Takagi-kun's reassignment to Product Development.

479
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Ready?

480
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,010
Happy send-off. Cheers.

481
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:15,010
-Cheers.
-W-w-w-w-wait.

482
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:19,010
Wait, it's not official yet, and

483
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:21,010
-a reassignment notice hasn't been issued either.
-What are you talking about?

484
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,020
It's a done deal.

485
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,020
It's better to celebrate early.

486
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:29,020
Mashima-san was concerned that Takagi-san's been down lately and planned it.

487
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,960
Mashima did?

488
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,960
Congratulations.

489
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,970
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

490
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:39,970
Everyone.

491
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:41,970
Then a word from Takagi-san, please.

492
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:45,970
Uh...ah...um...

493
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:50,980
Um...Thank you, everyone.

494
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:54,980
Really, thanks.

495
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:58,980
Although it was only for a short time, it was fun.

496
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:05,990
Everything was new to me.

497
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:09,000
[We're very sorry for what happened.]

498
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Like having to take a middle-aged lady's caustic remarks.

499
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
[We're very sorry.]

500
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And apologizing desperately.

501
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:22,010
I couldn't get used to the fact that it was my job to be complained at.

502
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:25,010
But the experience I got here

503
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:29,020
might be pretty invaluable to me.

504
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,950
[A minor complaint

505
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,950
may lead to a hit merchandise.]

506
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:35,960
[Customers' opinions are a mountain of gold.]

507
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,960
[We should cherish them.]

508
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,970
People's feelings go into using even one pencil or one notebook.

509
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:47,970
[Boys are pretty simple-minded, aren't they?]

510
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:49,970
[He must have felt smarter or something

511
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:51,970
just because he got a brand new notebook.]

512
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:53,970
[It's like he got motivated suddenly.]

513
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:59,980
[It means that stationery isn't just supplies.]

514
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:04,980
Like I realized many things like that.

515
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Takagi-san, is something wrong?

516
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
-No.
-There you go, in a daze again.

517
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,010
Don't worry unnecessarily about us.

518
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:29,010
No, that's not it.

519
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:35,010
Ever since I heard about this reassignment,
I've had this nagging feeling.

520
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:39,950
I finally realized what that is.

521
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,960
I'm not going to Product Development after all.

522
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,960
-What?
-You're not going to Product Development?

523
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,970
That's right. I'm staying here.

524
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:54,970
But why?

525
00:41:54,970 --> 00:42:02,970
I just remembered that I was able to change because I came here.

526
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:08,980
I finally realized that.

527
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,990
If I stay here, I feel I can help develop products

528
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:16,990
by coming up with ideas that aren't just self-serving.

529
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:20,990
That's my job.

530
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:23,000
Are you sure?

531
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
-Yes.
-Won't you regret it?

532
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
-Not at all.
-That's so like Takagi-san.

533
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,940
-I'm relieved.
-Kana-san.

534
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:33,940
I'm glad.

535
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,940
Mashima-kun, aren't you relieved too?

536
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,950
I really don't care one way or the other,

537
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:41,950
but it's true it's easier for me when we make apology visits if he stayed.

538
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:44,950
Let's not talk about that anymore.
Here's to

539
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:46,950
continued good working relationship.
-Cheers.

540
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:48,960
Cheers.

541
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:56,960
Alright, everyone.
Let's eat, let's eat.

542
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,970
Takagi-kun, Customer Service is a pretty interesting place, isn't it?

543
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:06,970
Yes, it's interesting and I'm also grateful.

544
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:08,980
That goes for me too.

545
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:13,980
Having a guy like you in Customer Service,

546
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,980
we feel reassured.

547
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:19,990
I have a feeling we can still change too.

548
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:29,000
Is there any squid left?

549
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:54,980
Okay, done.

550
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:57,980
Gochisousama.

551
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,980
-We're going first.
-Okay.

552
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,980
-Gochisousama.
-Oh, excuse me.

553
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,990
That will be 1,950 yen.

554
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:07,990
Oh, yes.

555
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:12,990
Keep the change.

556
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:15,000
Thank you.

557
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
-Thanks.
-Was that a boy?

558
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Or a girl?

559
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,010
Okay, it's ready. Here you go.

560
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:30,010
Wow~.
That's awesome. It's a wiener zoo.

561
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:33,010
Looks like Marumo-san might be late.

562
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:37,020
-Maybe we should start without him.
-Here you go.

563
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,020
Itadakimasu.
Itadakimasu.

564
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,960
How is it. Good?

565
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,960
Kujirice is the best.

566
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,960
Is this the last time I'll be making the wieners?

567
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,970
-Aya-chan, thank you.
Everything was delicious.

568
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:55,970
Thanks.
Ask your mommy to make it too, okay?

569
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:57,970
Kaoru, Tomoki.

570
00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:01,980
You have to eat everything your mommy makes for you.

571
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:06,980
I'm home. Sorry I'm late.

572
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:08,980
-Hey.
-Welcome home.

573
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:12,990
Wow, what's this, a zoo?

574
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:15,990
The Kujirice looks fancier than usual too.

575
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:18,990
Yeah, Dad's fired up today.

576
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:22,000
Here, Mamoru.
Yours is ready too.

577
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
That's huge.
You outdid yourself on this one.

578
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Aya, this too.

579
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
-Oh, okay.
-Itadakimasu.

580
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
-There's lots more.
-Wow, fancy. This is awesome.

581
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:39,010
It's finally tomorrow, huh?

582
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:41,980
Yes. Tomorrow.

583
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:44,850
But I'm relieved they're both in good spirits.

584
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:48,860
Yeah, I'm relieved too.

585
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:52,860
If they started crying on me,
I couldn't see them off with a smile.

586
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,860
Yes.

587
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:01,870
It was like that when Aya got married.

588
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:05,870
"Dad, thank you for taking care of me all these years."

589
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:07,870
She never did say anything like that.

590
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,880
Just as usual, we ate, took a bath,

591
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,880
said "good night" and went to bed

592
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:19,890
and the next day she got married.

593
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:21,890
Like she was just stepping out for a while.

594
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:25,890
That's so like Aya-chan.

595
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:33,900
To be honest, I felt lonely,
but I couldn't show that.

596
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,900
I understand.

597
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:41,910
But Mamoru,
you're not left with just loneliness.

598
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:46,950
After you see your child off,
you can puff up a wee bit with pride.

599
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:48,950
Puff up?

600
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:52,950
That maybe you finally attained parenthood.

601
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:55,960
You can puff up with pride.

602
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,960
Puff up with pride, huh?

603
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,960
Well, we can thank the kids for that too.

604
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,970
You finally become a parent after going through tough times.

605
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:10,970
Who's raising who, huh?

606
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:12,970
That's true.

607
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:20,980
But that Aya

608
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:24,990
promptly came back.

609
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:28,990
Like she just went to the convenience store or something, she said "I'm home."

610
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:30,990
That's so like Aya-chan.

611
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,940
I wish someone would take her one more time.

612
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:47,940
I want to puff up with pride as a parent just one more time.

613
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:59,950
Then don't chitchat and go to sleep, okay?

614
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:02,960
Good night.

615
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,960
-Aya-chan.
-Hm?

616
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,960
Look after Marumo, okay?

617
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,960
Marumo's no good by himself.

618
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:18,970
-Okay, got it.
-Good night.

619
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:21,970
-Good night.
-Good night.

620
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:33,990
Say, Mook.

621
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:36,990
You look after Marumo too, okay?

622
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:39,990
I know.

623
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:42,990
-Good night.
-Good night.

624
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:55,940
Having a hard time going to sleep?

625
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:02,950
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine if you follow the okite.

626
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,940
Okay, this should do it for now.

627
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:07,950
I'll send the rest a little at a time, okay?

628
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:11,950
How long are you guys gonna be eating?

629
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:13,950
-Marumo, another helping.
-No.

630
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:15,960
If you eat three bowls
you'll be a fatso for sure.

631
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,960
There'll be no turning back.

632
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:24,960
But I have to eat a lot while I can
because I have to say good bye to Boss.

633
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,970
Boss, it was only for a short time, but
thank you for your hard work.

634
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:30,970
I shall be forever be indebted to you.

635
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:32,970
Alright, then.
Take that with you.

636
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:35,980
-Really?
-Boss, please continue to treat me favorably.

637
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:39,980
-Please.
-Yup, same here.

638
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:42,000
It's time.
We gotta get going.

639
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,920
Clear everything for now.
Put everything away.

640
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,920
We'll be back.

641
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,920
Huh? We'll be back?

642
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,920
Oops, that was a mistake.

643
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,920
Okay, we're going.

644
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:58,930
Hmm. Would a dog understand?

645
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,930
-Then Kaoru next. Switch.
-Okay, switch.

646
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:25,960
Kaoru, Tomoki.

647
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,960
-Hello.
-Hello.

648
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,960
Hello.

649
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:32,970
For now, this is their change of clothes for today and tomorrow,

650
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:34,970
and their everyday necessities.

651
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:37,970
I'll get the rest packed up later.

652
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:40,970
Thank you.

653
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:44,970
Thank you for everything.

654
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:51,920
Kaoru, take care.

655
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,920
You don't have to hold back anything from your mommy and let her baby you.

656
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,920
Tomoki.

657
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,930
Tomoki, you have to stop being a baby.
You're a boy,

658
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:02,930
so you have to protect your mommy and Kaoru in place of your daddy.

659
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:04,930
Got it.

660
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:07,930
Stay close just like you've been.
Don't fight.

661
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:12,940
And...

662
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:16,940
I guess that's enough. Anyway, stay healthy.

663
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:27,950
Aw~. The bus is here.

664
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,960
Ayumi-san, I entrust these two to you.

665
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,960
Yes.

666
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,970
-Marumo, bye bye.
-Take care.

667
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:42,900
Yeah, you guys too.

668
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:45,900
Oh, that's right.

669
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:53,910
-Here. You can have this.
-What's this dirty thing. I don't want it.

670
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:57,910
-Mook, bye bye.
-Mook, bye bye.

671
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,920
Then...

672
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:19,940
Oh, that's right. Hey, hey, the okite.

673
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:21,940
The Okite Notebook's in the bag.

674
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:24,940
Don't forget the okite.

675
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,940
Take care.

676
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:34,950
-Don't forget.
-Marumo!

677
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:37,960
-Mook.
-Bye bye!

678
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,960
See you. Listen to your mom.

679
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:45,970
Mook! Marumo!

680
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:50,970
See you. Take care.

681
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,010
"Tomoki/We'll always love you/
We're always family/Kaoru"

682
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:38,020
[You guys wanna come to my place?]

683
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:41,020
[If you want to be together that much, come to my place.]

684
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:42,960
[Okay,]
[Takagi Marumo.]

685
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,960
[It's Mamoru.  Mamoru. What the heck is a Marumo?]

686
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:06,980
-[I'm hungry.]
-[Shall we eat something on the way home?]

687
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:10,980
-[Goma shio.]
-[Goma shio.]

688
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:12,980
[Don't get into that stuff.]

689
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:18,990
[I'm thinking about living with these kids.]

690
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:23,000
[-I want to stay with Marumo.
-Me too.]

691
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
[Marumo, let's play catch.]

692
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
[What was that?]

693
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
[You guys, we're not here to fetch balls, you know.]

694
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:37,010
[We're gonna answer real loud

695
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:40,010
so that Marumo can hear us.]

696
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:42,030
[Are you stupid?]

697
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:44,950
[Why did you believe what I said.]

698
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:49,960
[I don't have mommy or daddy, but I'm happy because I have Marumo.]

699
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:53,960
[It's okay because Marumo's with us.]

700
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,970
[I hate you, Marumo!]

701
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:02,970
[Stay together if you like each other and go our separate ways if you don't.]

702
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:04,970
[A family isn't something that should be taken lightly like that.]

703
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:10,980
[To stay together whether you like it or not, that's what family's all about.]

704
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:14,980
[-Thanks, Marumo.
-I love you, Marumo.]

705
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,920
Let's eat.

706
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:44,930
Oba-chan.

707
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:46,930
Yes?

708
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:52,940
Tomoki,
she's not Oba-chan, she's Mommy.

709
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:55,950
It doesn't matter if you call me Oba-chan or Mommy.

710
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:58,950
But...

711
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:01,950
Call me whatever makes you comfortable.

712
00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:04,950
Then I want to call you Mommy.

713
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,960
Me too.

714
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,960
Can we call you Mommy?

715
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,960
Really?
You'll call me Mommy?

716
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:23,970
Thank you.

717
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:29,910
Mommy.
So you didn't die.

718
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:34,920
You were surprised, weren't you? I'm sorry.

719
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,920
Were you really sick?

720
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,920
-What?
-Marumo told us.

721
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,930
That Mommy was battling the illness all by herself.

722
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:46,930
Mommy, you were fighting all by yourself, weren't you?

723
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:50,930
I suppose so.

724
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:55,940
Mommy, sorry we weren't there with you.

725
00:57:55,940 --> 00:58:01,940
Tomoki and Kaoru didn't know that Mommy was all alone.

726
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:06,950
Even if you get sick again, this time I'll be there to fight with you.

727
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:09,950
-Me too.
-Thank you.

728
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:17,960
Do you know, Mommy?
That family's the most important thing.

729
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,960
Marumo taught us.

730
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,970
Mommy.

731
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:25,990
Yes?

732
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:28,990
Thank you for being alive.

733
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,910
Thank you.

734
00:58:50,930 --> 00:58:53,930
-Oh, that's right.
-What?

735
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:58,930
I forgot to say thank you to Marumo.

736
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:04,940
You're right. We forgot.
He gave us the Okite Notebook too.

737
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:07,940
-What is that?
-Okite Notebook.

738
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:10,940
The okite that Marumo made are written in here.

739
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:15,950
Okite Notebook?

740
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:19,960
It's a promise we make so that we can all live in harmony.

741
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:24,960
We promise with the okite.
Marumo thought of them all.

742
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,900
Marumo's bossy.

743
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:32,900
We have to abide by them.
There's no exception to the okite.

744
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:39,910
But because we abided by the okite,
we were really happy every single day.

745
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:43,910
Everything was as Marumo said.
We always lived in harmony.

746
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,920
-Mommy.
-Yes?

747
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:54,920
Marumo easily gets mad and bossy but

748
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:56,930
he gets lonely real easily too.

749
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:58,930
And he cries easily too.

750
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:03,930
I wonder if I'll get to see Marumo again.

751
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:05,940
I wonder if I'll get to say thank you.

752
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,920
They're really gone.

753
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:03,930
Mamoru.

754
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:07,930
Mamoru, thanks.

755
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:11,930
Yeah.

756
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:15,930
Huh? Mamoru?

757
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,940
Did you say Mamoru?

758
01:01:35,890 --> 01:01:41,890
Are you, by chance, Sasakura?

759
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:57,910
You're Sasakura, aren't you?

760
01:01:57,910 --> 01:02:03,920
What do you mean woof?
Speak up properly.

761
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,920
What's that?

762
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:08,920
You're not gonna talk anymore?

763
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:11,930
Hey.

764
01:02:16,930 --> 01:02:22,940
I'm really all alone now.

765
01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:46,900
Aya-chan. What's up?

766
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:49,900
Oh, the kids forgot these downstairs

767
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:51,900
so I thought you could send them with their other stuff.

768
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:54,900
Oh, thanks.

769
01:02:58,910 --> 01:03:00,910
They're gone, aren't they?

770
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:03,910
Yeah.

771
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:08,910
It hasn't been this quiet in a long time, makes you feel restless, doesn't it?

772
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:18,930
Until now, the kids were here,

773
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:21,930
but I guess I shouldn't come barging in like this anymore.

774
01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:27,870
No, I'm okay with it.

775
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:31,870
Now that they're not here,

776
01:03:31,870 --> 01:03:34,880
we probably won't be seeing each other too much.

777
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:38,880
Well, I'm not sure about that.

778
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,880
How will it be?

779
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:44,890
Oh, I'll take those things the kids left behind.

780
01:03:44,890 --> 01:03:46,890
Ah, yes.

781
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:48,890
Oh, I'm sorry.

782
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:58,900
Marumo, we're back.

783
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:01,900
Oh! Ah, you scared me.
What is it?

784
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:04,910
-I'm home.
-I'm home.

785
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:07,910
Welcome home.
Or rather, what are you guys doing?

786
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:09,910
We thought Marumo might be crying and felt sorry for you

787
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:11,910
so we came back.

788
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:13,920
Marumo, what are you doing with Aya-chan?

789
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,920
Huh? What do you mean what? We were...

790
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,920
Just talking. You know, chitchatting?

791
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,930
That's right. We were exchanging chit and chat.

792
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:27,860
Yeah, that's what you call chitchatting. Yeah.

793
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:31,870
Oh? Where's Ayumi-san?
What happened to Ayumi-san?

794
01:04:31,870 --> 01:04:34,870
-She's downstairs.
-What?

795
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:47,880
Ayumi-san, I'm sorry.
I thought I talked them into it.

796
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,890
Don't worry, I'll return them to you.

797
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:54,890
It's alright.
I'm the one who brought them here.

798
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:56,890
What?

799
01:04:56,890 --> 01:05:02,900
From the time I left those children, for 4 years until today,

800
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:06,900
I'd been apologizing to them in my heart.

801
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:09,910
Now that they were coming back to me,

802
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:11,910
even though I knew they probably wouldn't forgive me,

803
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:17,910
I wanted to atone for my sin by raising them with great care.

804
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:20,920
But those kids

805
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:25,920
said to me, "Thank you for being alive."

806
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:31,860
They said "Thank you."

807
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:38,860
My feeling of rushing to make up was relieved a bit by that.

808
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:45,870
Mamoru-san,
thank you so much.

809
01:05:45,870 --> 01:05:50,880
No, I didn't do anything.

810
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,880
The person who raised those children to be that way

811
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:57,880
isn't just Junichirou, but you as well, Mamoru-san.

812
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:02,890
That's what I thought after I read this.

813
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:08,900
So for a little bit longer,

814
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:11,900
please take care of the children.

815
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:16,910
Are you sure?

816
01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:21,910
"We're family, even if we're apart."
Right?

817
01:06:21,910 --> 01:06:25,910
-Yes.
-If we're family even if we're apart,

818
01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:30,910
I'll go back to being a mother slowly, one step at a time.

819
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:36,930
You can see them anytime from now on.

820
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:38,930
There's no need to rush things.

821
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:43,930
Oyaji-san, I'm hungry.

822
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:45,930
Okay, I'll fix something for you then.

823
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:48,940
-For Mommy too.
-What, for Mommy too?

824
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:52,940
The whole family's going to eat together.
Marumo and Mommy are family, right?

825
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:56,950
Onee-chan,
what about Oyaji-san and Aya-chan?

826
01:06:56,950 --> 01:07:00,950
Oyaji-san and Aya-chan are family too.

827
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:05,950
We're all family.
This is fun. It gives you a warm feeling.

828
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,960
Okay, Kaoru, Tomoki. Give me a hand.

829
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:16,970
Mommy. Make us your castella for us too.

830
01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:20,970
-What?
-The castella from "Guri and Gura."

831
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:22,970
But...

832
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:26,910
Come on over here then.

833
01:07:56,940 --> 01:08:00,940
Oh, shoot.
Kaoru, Tomoki, wake up. You're gonna be late.

834
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:02,940
Really.
We're late.

835
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:04,950
Hurry, hurry. Come on, hurry.

836
01:08:08,950 --> 01:08:11,950
-Marumo, tie my hair.
-Oh, okay,

837
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:16,960
Tomoki, hurry.

838
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:19,960
Don't move, Kaoru.
Hurry, Tomoki. Hurry, Tomoki.

839
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:22,960
Okay, how's that.

840
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:27,900
Huh? It's straight. Yeah.
Okay.

841
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:29,910
Okay, okay.

842
01:08:29,910 --> 01:08:32,910
Tomoki, finish eating.
We're gonna be late.

843
01:08:32,910 --> 01:08:34,910
Let's go, let's go.
We're going.

844
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:36,910
-See you later.
-Okay.

845
01:08:36,910 --> 01:08:38,910
-Okay, Tomoki, we're going.
-See you later.

846
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,920
Hey, Kaoru, what are you doing?
Hurry up, we're going.

847
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:48,920
Say, Marumo.

848
01:08:50,930 --> 01:08:52,930
What?

849
01:08:52,930 --> 01:08:55,930
Mook's acting strange lately, isn't he?

850
01:08:55,930 --> 01:09:00,940
Yeah.
He doesn't talk at all anymore.

851
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:03,940
I wonder if something happened.

852
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:12,940
I guess I hadn't explained to you guys yet.

853
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:17,950
Mook won't be talking anymore.

854
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:20,960
-How come?
-Why?

855
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,960
But it's alright.

856
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:27,900
The Mook that talks will always be in our heart.

857
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:29,900
Right?

858
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:36,910
You're gonna be late.

859
01:09:36,910 --> 01:09:39,910
Oh, he does talk.
Okay, I'm going then.

860
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:41,910
See you later.

861
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:49,920
What are you crying for, Marumo?

862
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,920
What~!

863
01:11:37,890 --> 01:11:40,900
There's one more announcement.

864
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:43,900
-This is my girlfriend.
-I'm Hana.

865
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:46,900
What~!

866
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:48,900
Yea!

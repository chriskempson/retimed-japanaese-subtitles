1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,700
-Marumo?
-Hm?

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,710
-What are we having for dinner tonight?
-You're

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,710
-already worried about dinner?
-We haven't even had breakfast yet.

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,710
-But...
-Let's see...

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,710
Tonight, how about stir fried meat and vegetables?

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,720
-We had that yesterday too, didn't we?
-What are you talking about?

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,720
Yesterday we had stir fried vegetables.
The day before that was stir fried meat.

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,720
-They're completely different.
-Oh, yeah.

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,730
-Huh?
-Hm?

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,730
Okay, done.

11
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,730
That's right. You wanna go eat

12
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,730
something good this weekend?

13
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,740
Yay~.
Yay~.

14
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,740
Are you sure?

15
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,740
Yeah, I'm getting my bonus.

16
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,740
You get tired of eating eggs all the time, right?
How about sushi?

17
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,750
What will you have?
Ikura*? Or uni**? (*salmon roe; **sea urchin)

18
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,750
-Egg.
-Egg.

19
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,750
What, so you end up getting the same thing wherever you go.

20
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,750
But it's so good.

21
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,760
-Kohada*. (*shad)
-What?

22
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,760
But it's so good. Kohada.

23
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,690
Are you really a dog?

24
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,700
Yeah.

25
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,700
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

26
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,700
-Morning.
-Good morning.

27
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,710
Oh, Tami-san.

28
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,710
Where can I buy cheap cute

29
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,710
-children's clothes?
-Let's see.

30
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,710
-Are they for the twins?
-Yeah, we're getting our bonus this week, right?

31
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,710
I thought I'd buy them new clothes.

32
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,720
Kids outgrow their clothes so fast.

33
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,720
That's the thing.

34
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,720
Plus, Tomoki gets them dirty, rips them...

35
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,720
I know what you mean. Boys tend to destroy their clothes.

36
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,730
In that respect, girls are more responsible.

37
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,730
Takagi-san, you sound like a real father.

38
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,730
What? Really?

39
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,740
Come to think of it, there were some ads in today's paper.

40
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,740
This, this, this, this.

41
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,740
Oh, this will be nice for Kaoru-chan.

42
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,740
Which one? This? This? That's nice.

43
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,750
-What about this one? For Tomoki-kun.
-Good.

44
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,750
-How about this?
-This? This is nice.

45
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,750
That's very Kaoru.
Oh, this is nice for Kaoru-chan too.

46
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:03,690
Wait. This isn't Kaoru's style.

47
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,700
Hello, this is Kujira.

48
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,700
This is Tomizawa... Oh, Aya?

49
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,700
Tatsuya?

50
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,710
Good night.
Good night.

51
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,720
[It's not going to work after all, is it?]

52
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,720
[I'm sorry.]

53
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,730
Excuse me.

54
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,730
Makimura-san.

55
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:54,740
I hope we can go back to being the co-workers we were before.

56
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:04,680
Back to laughing and joking around as co-workers.

57
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,680
Takagi-san.

58
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:14,690
We should.  Yes, like before.

59
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,700
Aw.
I want to go to Manami-chan's house too.

60
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,700
Not today.
Just the girls are going to play.

61
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,710
Alright.

62
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,710
Then you be good and stay home with Mook, okay?

63
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,710
-See you later.
-Okay, bye bye.

64
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,710
Bye bye.

65
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,720
That's no fun.

66
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,720
I'm relieved you're looking well.

67
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,720
You look like you're doing well yourself.

68
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:54,730
Actually, I'm getting married again in the fall.

69
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,740
After we broke up,

70
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,740
I thought I'd never marry again,

71
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,670
but I guess you never know.

72
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,680
I see.

73
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,680
You've got to do better this time.

74
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,680
Yeah.

75
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,690
That's right.
I came to return this today.

76
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,690
You left it at the house.

77
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,690
I've been meaning to return it, but never got around to it.

78
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,700
Oh, Aya-chan?

79
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,720
-Aya-chan, are you getting married?
-What?

80
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,720
Hey, Tomoki.
What are you saying?

81
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,720
But I'm gonna be sad if she gets married.

82
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,730
I don't want her to go away.

83
00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:00,750
I'm pretty sure I won't marry again.

84
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,670
Really? Who was that guy you were with?

85
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:08,670
My ex-husband. The person I divorced.

86
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,680
What does he want now?

87
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,680
Nothing important.  No need to be concerned.

88
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,680
So Aya-chan's not getting married.
I'm relieved.

89
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,710
Kaoru.

90
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,720
Wow, it's big.

91
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,670
Kaoru. Kaoru-chan, are you alright?

92
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,670
Oba-chan?

93
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:13,670
You're okay now.
You were startled, weren't you?

94
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,680
You're alright now.

95
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,690
Oba-chan.

96
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,690
Your clothes are going to get dirty.

97
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,690
It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.

98
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,700
I'm home.

99
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,710
-Hi, Marumo.
-Where's Kaoru?

100
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,710
She went to Manami-chan's house.

101
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,710
Oh.
Shall we go pick her up since it's getting kinda late?

102
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,720
It's cute.

103
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,650
How is it? Looks like it's just the right size too.
Shall we get this one?

104
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,660
Kaoru-chan went home already.

105
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:15,670
Where did that girl go?
Thanks, Manami-chan.

106
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,670
Tomoki, let's go.

107
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,670
Thank you for waiting.

108
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,680
How's Tomoki-kun? Is he doing well?

109
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,680
Yes, he's doing real well.

110
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,680
Are you getting along with Takagi-san?

111
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,680
Yes, Tomoki and Marumo, we're all buddies.

112
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,690
Marumo's not our daddy or mommy, but

113
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,690
he's always with us.

114
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,690
Because our daddy and mommy died.

115
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,700
Do you remember your mommy?

116
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,700
Not too well.
But she was really kind.

117
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,710
That's what Daddy said.
She was kind and very pretty

118
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,710
and loved Kaoru and Tomoki very much.

119
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,650
-Onee-chan.
-Kaoru.

120
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,660
-Kaoru.
-Oh, that's Onee-chan's umbrella.

121
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:24,670
-Kaoru.
-Where did Onee-chan go?

122
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,670
What should we do, Marumo?

123
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,670
-Onee-chan's gone away.
-Tomoki, come.

124
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,680
Excuse me

125
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,680
Watch out, watch out. Hey, watch it.

126
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,690
Kaoru's missing.

127
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,690
-Missing?
-She disappeared. What should we do?

128
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,690
Wait. First of all, calm down.

129
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,690
Um...so...That's

130
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,690
-the older sister of the twins, right?
-Yes, that's right.

131
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,700
What was she wearing today?
-She was wearing a white top today.

132
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,700
Her hair was tied in the back.

133
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,700
Wait. Come to think of it, seems I saw her somewhere.

134
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,700
-Where? Try to remember.
-Don't pull, don't pull.

135
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,640
Oh, it was there. By the canal. The canal.

136
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:11,650
-Kaoru.
-Onee-chan.

137
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,650
-Kaoru.
-That...

138
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,650
Huh?

139
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,650
It looks like Onee-chan's.

140
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:29,660
Marumo. Marumo.

141
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,680
What am I going to do if something happened to Kaoru?

142
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:54,690
Kaoru! Kaoru! Kaoru!

143
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,710
-Hello.
-Takagi-san,

144
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,710
Kaoru-chan's been found.

145
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,680
Kaoru, where were you?
I...

146
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,690
What are you doing here?

147
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,690
Oh, um..a passing car

148
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:09,690
splashed water on Kaoru-chan
and she got all dirty.

149
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,700
Yeah.
She saw her coincidentally on the street

150
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,700
and helped her.

151
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,700
I'm sorry. I couldn't just leave her there.

152
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:28,710
-Please leave.
-Why?

153
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:32,720
Do you remember what you said last time?

154
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,720
[I'll try not to

155
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,720
ever see those children again.]

156
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,730
Yes.

157
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,730
Wait, Marumo.
Why are you getting mad at Oba-chan?

158
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,730
She bought me a new dress.

159
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,730
There's one for Tomoki too.

160
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,730
Really?

161
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,670
-Thank you.
-Marumo, say

162
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,670
thank you to Oba-chan.

163
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,680
-Please mind your own business.
-Marumo.

164
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,680
-It's alright, Kaoru-chan.
-Please leave.

165
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,720
Wow, cool. 

166
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:54,740
Wow, cool.  It fits just right, doesn't it?

167
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,670
It looks good on me, doesn't it?

168
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,680
That was awful, Marumo. What you said to Oba-chan.

169
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,680
I'm sorry I was late coming home.

170
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,690
But why did you get mad at Oba-chan?

171
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,690
She helped in when I didn't know what to do.

172
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,690
Oba-chan was really kind.

173
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,690
We ate pancakes together
and I had a really good time.

174
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,700
Don't see that Oba-chan anymore.

175
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,700
Why? Why can't I see her?

176
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,700
Because I said so.

177
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,700
That doesn't make any sense.
Isn't she Marumo's friend?

178
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,700
-Even if it doesn't make sense.
-That's strange, Marumo.

179
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,710
I don't care if it's strange or whatever, don't see her anymore!

180
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:39,710
No.
I don't understand.

181
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,710
You're terrible, Marumo.

182
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,720
No, no, no.

183
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,720
Kaoru!

184
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:01,660
Marumo. I hate you, Marumo.

185
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,690
I'm sorry, Aya-chan.

186
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:32,700
I don't mind you sleeping here at all, but are you sure it's okay with Marumo-san?

187
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,700
I don't care.
Marumo's being awful.

188
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,710
I used to get scolded by my dad all the time too.

189
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,710
Was Oyaji-san scary?

190
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,710
Yeah, he was scary.

191
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:51,710
He slapped me really hard one time.

192
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:59,660
But, you know, you're not going to find too many people

193
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,660
who cares enough to really scold you.

194
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,660
Although back then, I didn't realize that.
All he did was annoy me.

195
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,670
I hope you guys make up tomorrow.

196
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,670
Good night.

197
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:17,680
-Good night.
-Good night.

198
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,690
I'm the worst, aren't I?

199
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,700
When I heard about Ayumi-san,

200
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,700
I lost my head and before I knew it, I raised my hand.

201
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,710
What a petty guy I am.

202
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,680
Takagi-kun, I got a call from Product Development

203
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,680
-a little while ago.
-Yes.

204
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,680
That ball point pen with the ear cleaner.

205
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,690
They're thinking about marketing it for sale next year.

206
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,690
-What?
-Does that mean his proposal went through?

207
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,690
Although the final decision hasn't been made yet.

208
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,690
That's great, Takagi-kun.

209
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,700
-Awesome. I'm so happy for you.
-Thank you.

210
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,700
Oh, also, can I talk to you for a minute?

211
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,700
Yes?

212
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:34,710
Actually, although it's not like I've gotten official word,

213
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,710
but there appears to be

214
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,710
a movement at Product Development to bring you back.

215
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,710
What?

216
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:45,720
In your case, you have to think about the children too,

217
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,720
but just keep it in mind.

218
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,720
Yes.

219
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,680
Say, guys, did you have fun at school?

220
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:21,690
What do you like most at school?
Language? Music?

221
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,690
It's lunch time for me.

222
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:29,700
Figures. Why did I bother to ask.

223
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,700
Onee-chan...

224
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,700
what do you like most at school.
Marumo's asking.

225
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,710
-The 20-minute break.
-She said the 20-minute break.

226
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:47,720
Oh, so you like the 20-minute break.

227
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,720
Oh, that's right. What do you want to eat on Sunday?

228
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,720
What do you want to eat?

229
00:17:53,720 --> 00:18:00,660
Onee-chan. What do you want to eat on Sunday? Marumo's asking.

230
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,660
-Spaghetti.
-What?

231
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:08,670
-She said hamburger.
-Spaghetti.

232
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,670
Busted.

233
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,670
You...seriously.

234
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,680
-Spa...
-Gochisousama.

235
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,710
Onee-chan.

236
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,710
Oh, that's right.

237
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,660
What's this?

238
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,660
"Put this against your ear.
Tomoki"

239
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,670
This?

240
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:21,680
Marumo, if you need something, call us with this.

241
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,680
-Huh?
-Put the cup to your mouth

242
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,680
when you want to talk.
Over.

243
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,680
I see.

244
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,690
But isn't it faster to talk directly?

245
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:36,690
Since you're in the next room. Over.

246
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:41,700
It's because you guys are fighting.
Hurry up and make up please. Over.

247
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,700
What's Kaoru doing? Over.

248
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,700
She's already asleep. Over.

249
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:58,650
What can I do to get Kaoru in a better mood. Over.

250
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:03,650
You can just say I'm sorry.
You're good at it, aren't you, Marumo?

251
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:07,650
You do it at work all the time. Over.

252
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:11,660
Work's different from home.
Over.

253
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:15,660
You're hopeless.
I'll teach you something good then.

254
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,660
It's a magical spell to make up.

255
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:21,670
You say, "Love ya, love ya, really love ya
Pekorinko Beam."

256
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:25,670
Huh? Huh? Love ya love ya what?
I'm totally lost. What? Over.

257
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:29,680
Love ya, love ya, really love ya
Pekorinko Beam. Over.

258
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,680
Wh-What are you saying?
Over. Over.

259
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,680
Everyone's saying that at school.
I'll teach you next time.

260
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,690
I'm going to sleep so I'm hanging up now.
Bye bye. Click.

261
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,690
W-w-w-wait. Wait.
Hello. Over.

262
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,690
Over. Oh.

263
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,690
Hey.

264
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,700
How about a drink?
The kids are already asleep, aren't they?

265
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,700
Yes.

266
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,730
Do you think I'm wrong?

267
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,740
It's making me think.

268
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,740
That in spite of the fact that their real parent is alive,

269
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,740
if it's the right thing to do to keep it a secret from those kids.

270
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,740
If I shouldn't let them meet properly.

271
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,690
While saying I'm doing this for those kids,

272
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:02,690
I'm wondering if I'm not letting them see her for my own selfish reason.

273
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:05,700
Mamoru.

274
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,700
I hit Kaoru.

275
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,700
I was surprised myself.

276
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:25,710
You know, I slapped Aya once too.

277
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,720
It must have been when she was in high school.

278
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,720
It was getting real late but she wasn't home, so

279
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,730
I worried and worried,

280
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:39,730
and after worrying so much, I got pissed and slapped her.

281
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:43,730
But isn't that alright?

282
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,740
-What?
-What I'm trying to say is

283
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,740
this thing with Kaoru happened because

284
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,740
you sincerely care for those kids, right?

285
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:01,690
You're already a good father to those kids.

286
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,720
Those kids are sure growing, Sasakura.

287
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,730
Tomoki grew 2 whole centimeters.

288
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:56,670
They learn all kinds of things at school every day.

289
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:00,680
Things like hiragana,
addition, subtraction,

290
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:05,680
new games,
and stupid jokes.

291
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,690
Tomoki, that kid...

292
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:12,690
he's always making us laugh by talking about

293
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:15,690
stuff like poop and butt.

294
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:20,690
Grade school boys are real fools, aren't they?

295
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:28,710
Kaoru is...she's strong-minded, isn't she?

296
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:33,710
She's stubborn
and doesn't hesitate to fight with the boys.

297
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:36,710
Really, I'd like to see their parent.

298
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:40,710
Yeah, that's you, huh?

299
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,720
Anyway,

300
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,720
the kids are doing well, so don't worry.

301
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,670
Sasakura.

302
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:07,680
I got in touch with Ayumi-san.

303
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,680
What should I do?

304
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,680
Should I

305
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:19,690
tell them that she's their mother and let them meet her?

306
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:24,690
Should I tell them that she was really alive and let them meet properly?

307
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:32,700
Am I being selfish if I don't let them meet?

308
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:41,710
Because those kids have become part of my life now.

309
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:46,710
Because I really love those kids.

310
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:58,660
After meeting Ayumi-san, Kaoru said she was really kind to her.

311
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:01,670
That she had a good time.

312
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:08,670
When I heard that, to be honest, I was really jealous of Ayumi-san.

313
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,670
Isn't that funny?

314
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,680
Why do I feel so shaken?

315
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:29,690
Sasakura, what do you think? Tell me.

316
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:33,700
I don't know what I should do.

317
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,700
What would you do?

318
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:44,710
Come on, tell me.

319
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:46,710
Tell me.

320
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,710
Tell me.

321
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:57,650
Onee-chan, Marumo's late, isn't he?

322
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,680
Clothes. They're circled.

323
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:30,680
I wonder if Marumo was going to buy them for us.

324
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:36,690
Onee-chan, you know that time

325
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:40,700
Marumo went splashing into the river.

326
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,700
What?

327
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:48,710
He jumped into the river looking for you.

328
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:53,710
He worried lots about Onee-chan.

329
00:27:55,650 --> 00:28:00,650
He was yelling Kaoru, Kaoru many times.

330
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,640
Kaoru, are you still fighting with Mamoru?

331
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:09,650
You know, you may not understand very well right now, but

332
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,650
there's something I want you to remember.

333
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,660
When Mamoru hit Kaoru

334
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:19,660
he had his own reason.

335
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,660
Of course, a parent is human too, so

336
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,670
sometimes he may misunderstand and scold you, and

337
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:28,670
there may be times he says things only from his point of view.

338
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:31,670
But, you know,

339
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:35,680
I think Mamoru hit you because he

340
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,680
truly truly cherishes you.

341
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,690
Mamoru was really really

342
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:46,690
worried about you, you know.

343
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:55,630
Kaoru, you were sad when he hit you, weren't you?
It hurt, didn't it?

344
00:29:55,630 --> 00:30:01,640
It pained Mamoru too for hitting you. 

345
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:05,640
It saddened him and pained his heart.

346
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,650
I'm home.

347
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,660
I'm home.

348
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:29,670
Hi, Marumo.
Over.

349
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,670
I'm home.

350
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:35,670
You wanna go eat dinner?
Go for spaghetti? Over.

351
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:41,680
Okay. But we have to do our homework first.
Wait for a while. Over.

352
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:48,690
Homework?
I see. Good for you.

353
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:50,690
Alright. Over.

354
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:54,690
Sorry.
Let's go eat after we finish our homework, okay?

355
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:58,700
Later. Click.

356
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:17,710
Maybe I'll work on that for a change.

357
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:35,730
How's this?

358
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:38,740
Looks good.
Then let's color it.

359
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,740
Yeah, looking good.

360
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,680
Oh, must've fell asleep.

361
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:14,690
Hello. Hello. Over.

362
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,720
"Gold Medal
Marumo"

363
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:53,670
"To Marumo
Thank you taking care of us all the time."

364
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:57,670
"For making our meals."

365
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:02,680
"For tying my hair."

366
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,680
"For playing catch with us."

367
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,680
"Thank you."

368
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,690
"Even though Marumo has a face like cat,

369
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,690
you're the coolest in the whole world."

370
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:19,700
"Even though you're not Daddy or Mommy,

371
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:23,700
we love Marumo the most in the whole world."

372
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,700
"Kaoru"
"Tomoki"

373
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,720
Excuse me.
Are the kids here?

374
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,720
Oh.
They took Mook for a walk with Aya.

375
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,720
Thanks.

376
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,670
Kaoru, Tomoki.

377
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,670
It's Marumo.

378
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:22,690
This. This.

379
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:25,690
Yeah. We wrote it together.

380
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:36,710
I never got a gold medal before.

381
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:40,710
I never got first place in anything.

382
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:43,710
They said they were going to give it to Marumo-san

383
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,710
and they worked on it secretly.

384
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:54,660
I never thought I'd get something like this from you guys.

385
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:59,660
Marumo, do you know what today is?

386
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:02,660
Today is June 19. It's Father's Day.

387
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:08,670
Thanks for always taking care of us.

388
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,670
Marumo, thank you.

389
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,680
You guys...

390
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,690
Marumo does mommy's job too, so

391
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:26,690
we decided that Mother's Day is Marumo's day too.

392
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:33,690
Mother's Day and Father's Day are both Marumo's Day.

393
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:15,670
Oh, Marumo. What about the magical spell?

394
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,680
Onee-chan.

395
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,680
Ready.
Love ya, love ya, really love ya

396
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,680
Pekorinko Beam.

397
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,690
Love ya, love ya, really love ya
Pekorinko Beam.

398
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,690
Love ya, love ya, really love ya
Pekorinko Beam.

399
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:41,700
Love ya, love ya, really love ya
Pekorinko Beam.

400
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,640
You finally made up, so don't fight anymore.

401
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,640
Okay, then today's okite is gonna be Pekorinko Beam.

402
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,650
-Right, Kaoru?
-Yeah, let's do that.

403
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:58,650
-Let's do that.
-You guys have okite, huh?

404
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,650
Yeah.
It's our promise so that we can live in harmony.

405
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:04,650
Really.
What other ones do you have?

406
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:07,660
Kids will be kids.
Dogs will be dogs.

407
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,660
-What's that about?
-And enryo is muryou*. (*enryo-to hold back; muryou-free)

408
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:14,660
That's supposed to be enryo is muyou*. (muyou-unnecessary)

409
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:18,670
There, all ready.
Aya's Deluxe Father's Day Special Dinner.

410
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:21,670
Wow. Looks yummy.

411
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,670
-Looks delicious.
-Don't they, though?

412
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,680
Awesome.
Did you make all this, Aya-chan?

413
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,680
-Yes, I did.
-Well, we won't know how they taste

414
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,680
until we try them, huh?

415
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,680
Hey, of course everything will be delicious.

416
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,680
Okay, let's eat, let's eat.

417
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,690
Oh, Tomoki.

418
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:42,690
Ready. Here you go, Oyaji-san.

419
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:44,690
-What? Oyaji-san?
-What is it?

420
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:46,700
-What is it?
-"Should massage coupon"

421
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,630
We'll do it anytime, okay?

422
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,630
That was nice, huh, Grandpa?

423
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:54,640
Tap tap on the shoulder...
Hey, who's a grandpa.

424
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,640
Thank you, thank you. I like it.
I'll make good use of them.

425
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,640
-Okay.
-Okay.

426
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,650
-Itadakimasu.
-Itadakimasu.

427
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:05,650
-Let's see...
-How did they turn out?

428
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,650
Yum.

429
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,650
Yeah, yum.

430
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,660
-Dad.
-Yes.

431
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:24,670
Here. Father's Day present.

432
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:27,670
You didn't have to get me anything.

433
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:30,670
-Can I open it?
-Go ahead.

434
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,680
-Oh, is it a hand towel?
-Yeah.

435
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,680
It's a kujira*. Nice design.
(*whale - name of the restaurant)

436
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,690
-Let's see.  How is it?
-Nice.

437
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,690
Is it? Thanks.

438
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:54,630
Families are amazing, aren't they?

439
00:38:54,630 --> 00:39:00,640
I mean, even if they have a fight,
before you know it, they make up,

440
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,640
and they fight and make up again.

441
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,640
They'll probably keep on repeating that over and over.

442
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:17,650
I think I understand a little bit now why my marriage failed.

443
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:25,660
I was only thinking about myself.

444
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:33,670
All I could think about was things like

445
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,670
how much I was loved.

446
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:40,680
When I watch Takagi-san, I can see

447
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:46,680
how he's not thinking of anything but doing everything he can for those kids,

448
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,680
how he seriously agonizes over those kids.

449
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:57,620
And how those kids really love Takagi-san too.

450
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:04,630
I felt that they hearts are bound together.

451
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:12,640
I envy that.

452
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:25,650
It would be nice if someday if I could have a family like that too.

453
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:28,660
What?

454
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,660
Good night then.

455
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,660
Good night.

456
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,670
Good night.

457
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:57,620
They have their memories with Sasakura.
"After a fight, it's Pekorinko Beam"

458
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:03,620
So now I'm gonna fill this up with lots of their memories.

459
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:10,630
Marumo.

460
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:13,640
Nothing.

461
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,640
What?

462
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,640
Don't you think it's kinda funny?

463
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,640
That I've come to have a

464
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,650
regular conversation with you like a friend.

465
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:26,650
But aren't we friends?

466
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:32,660
We're not friends. Are we?

467
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,680
Did it fall out of the photo album?

468
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,700
Here it is.

469
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,710
Here.

470
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,720
Mook, did I wake you up?
Sorry.

471
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:44,730
What's that?

472
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:47,750
Kaoru, no.

473
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:51,670
Mook, what is it?
Let me see.

474
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,670
Mook.

475
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,680
Oba-chan?

476
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,700
Daddy?

477
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,700
Why?

478
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:40,710
Kaoru?

479
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,660

1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,010
-Marumo, wake up.
-Huh? What happened?

2
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,010
Tie my hair.

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,010
What?

4
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:21,010
Kaoru, put down your ransel first.
Today's Sunday.

5
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,020
No, today's Sunday visit.
Remember, I gave you the flyer?

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,020
Flyer?

7
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:31,020
Oh, Sunday visit.

8
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,030
Marumo, let's go. We're gonna be late.

9
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,030
-Oh, I give up.
-Tomoki, you too. Hurry.

10
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,040
Let's go, let's go.

11
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,040
To buy things, we need money.

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,040
To earn that money, people have various occupations.

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,050
Our family is pan-ya-san*.
*(pan-bread, ya-shop)

14
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,050
Yes, pan-ya-san is one too.

15
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,050
Then what other ya-san are there? Anyone know?

16
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,050
-Cake-ya-san.
-Osushi-ya-san.

17
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,990
Soba*-ya-san. (*Japanese noodle)
-Pizza-ya-san.

18
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,990
Gambari*-ya-san. (*someone who tries very hard)

19
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:06,990
Tere*-ya-san. (*Shy person; has nothing to do with stores, but ends with ya-san)

20
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,000
Okay, okay, okay.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I thought I heard tere-ya-san just now, but oh well...

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Then besides shops and stores

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,010
what other jobs are there?
Does anyone know?

24
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,010
I think school teacher is a job too.

25
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,010
That's right. There are not only shops,

26
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:31,020
but teachers earn money by educating everyone.

27
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,020
Okay, I'm going to give you homework now.

28
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,030
Starting now, you are all members of the job exploration team.

29
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,030
Find out anything you can about

30
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,040
your father or your mother's job.

31
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,040
You'll be reporting on it at the next class.

32
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,990
-Hello.
-Hello. Takagi-san?

33
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,990
Kana-san, what's up?

34
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,990
Are you free today?

35
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,000
Of course I'm free as can be, but what is it?

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Then how about meeting me for lunch?

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yes, of course.

38
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,010
It's good.

39
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,010
What were you doing this morning?

40
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,010
Oh, today was the day of Sunday visit.

41
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,020
-Sunday visit.
-Oh, um...

42
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,020
Sun... I made a quick visit.

43
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,020
There was a bazaar in the neighborhood,
so I dropped in for a visit.

44
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,030
That sounds like fun.

45
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,030
It's important to get along with your neighbors, isn't it?

46
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,030
Well, yes...

47
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,040
When I opened the window, suddenly I see Yonesuke*. (*TV personality)

48
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,040
What?
-With his huge rice scoop.

49
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,040
-Really?
-Really, it's true.

50
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,980
I was so nervous he was going to make a dash at me.

51
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,980
Oh, and I also saw that guy...that...

52
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,980
Atou Kai*.(*Actor)
-Ah, yes.

53
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,990
He was eating dumplings at the neighborhood shopping district.

54
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:18,990
Oh my, Atou-san.
Are you making a side trip?

55
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,000
-Kana-san?
-Yes?

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
-Takiguchi Junpei*? (*voice actor)
-Yes.

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So you do things like impersonation too.

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,010
Oh dear, how embarrassing.
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,010
Oh?

60
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,010
Hello?

61
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,010
Marumo?

62
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,020
What's wrong, Kaoru?

63
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,020
We're hungry.

64
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,020
Hungry? What about school lunch?

65
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:55,030
School was only half day.
We don't get school lunch on Sunday visit days.

66
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,030
-Really?
-Hurry up and come home.

67
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,970
Seriously.
Okay, just wait.

68
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,970
I'm coming home now, okay?

69
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,980
Kana-san, I'm sorry.
A neighbor just called

70
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,980
and asked me to come back to the bazaar.

71
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,990
Oh, I guess we've been talking for a while now.

72
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,990
-I'm sorry.
-That's alright.

73
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,990
I'll see you at the office tomorrow.

74
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:29,000
Yes.
I'll e-mail you later.

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'll be waiting.

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
See you then.

77
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,010
Marumo-san.
What's your job, Marumo-san?

78
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,010
-What ya-san are you?
-Wait, wait a minute.

79
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,020
Let me change first.

80
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,020
What ya-san are you?

81
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,020
Alright, I'm a bunbougu*-ya-san. (*stationery)
You guys use them too.

82
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,030
Notebooks, erasers, and pencils.
Right?

83
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,040
-Thank you.
-I work for Akebono Office Supplies

84
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,960
in a department called Customer Service.

85
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,970
-Customer Service?
-Yes.

86
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,970
It's not a store?

87
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,970
How should I say this?

88
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:14,970
Um...You know, when customers use things like notebooks and pencils?

89
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:19,980
And when they don't understand something or find something wrong,

90
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,980
they call our department.

91
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,980
-I don't get it.
-No.

92
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,990
Yes, it's an e-mail from Kana-san.

93
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,990
You're a bunbougu-ya-san, but you don't sell anything?

94
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,990
I'm busy right now.
Ask me later.

95
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,000
-How much do you get paid?
-How much?

96
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Probably not much.

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Be quiet.
It's the important part right now.

98
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'll tell you later.
Later. Later. Later. Okay?

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,010
Aw~.
But we don't get what you do.

100
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,010
Oh, I want to go see Marumo's office.

101
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,010
You know that's impossible.
They don't know

102
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,010
about you guys at work.

103
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,020
But Manami-chan said she's going to visit her daddy's office.

104
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,020
We do what we do, and other people do what they do.

105
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,960
But it's our homework.

106
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,960
Then use your imagination and write something up.

107
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,960
Make a virtual trip to my workplace.
Do it virtually.

108
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,970
I don't get it. Tomoki, let's go.

109
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,970
Shoot, I made a mistake.
I wrote virtual.

110
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:23,980
-What should we do about our homework?
-We don't have anything to write about.

111
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,990
-Here you go...
-Welcome.

112
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:42,000
That's so unbecoming, a grown man walking around with a cell phone in one hand.

113
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
-Are you e-mailing?
-You're here again? It's Sunday, you know.

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
He's been drinking since before dark.

115
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You must have lots of free time.

116
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,010
Who are you e-mailing?

117
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,010
Oh, Kana-san.

118
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:59,010
Kana-san is the person I'm currently dating...

119
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:01,030
An idol-like presence at Akebono Office Supplies,

120
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,950
PR Department's Makimura Kana-san, right?
I'm quite tired of hearing about her.

121
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,950
Who would have thought that Takagi-san would be going out with her.

122
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:12,960
Yeah, she's beautiful and she's like The Woman Who Can Do It All

123
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,960
Oh, have you met her, Aya-san?

124
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,960
Just briefly.

125
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,970
But you're prettier, Aya-san.

126
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,970
Hm? What?

127
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,970
Nothing.

128
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,970
So what did she say in her e-mail?

129
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,980
She said "Lunch was fun today, wasn't it?"

130
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,980
-You were with her today too?
-You'd think they see enough of each other at work every day.

131
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,980
What? What? But

132
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,990
isn't that what going out with someone is all about?

133
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,990
Isn't it? Huh?

134
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:47,990
Oh, sorry. Say, how should I reply to this?

135
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,000
-When did you get it?
-About 2 hours ago.

136
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You ignored it for 2 hours?

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But I didn't know what to say.

138
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I've been entering and deleting, entering and deleting all this time.

139
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,010
-For 2 hours.
-It doesn't matter what you say.

140
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,970
All she wants to do is chit chat so

141
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,840
-just reply appropriately.
-That appropriately is the difficult part.

142
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,850
-Dummy, you dummy.
-Ouch.

143
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,850
Acting so silly.

144
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,850
But I'm surprised she understood your situation with the twins.

145
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:16,860
Well, um...
I haven't told her about the twins yet.

146
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,860
What? You haven't told her about the kids yet?

147
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,860
Hey. I don't care if you let her get to your head, but

148
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,870
shouldn't you be placing the kids first?
They're not something that should be hidden.

149
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,870
Yes, I know that.

150
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,880
Hey, you're gonna be late. Wake up.

151
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,890
No school today.

152
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,890
-Why?
-To switch the day off with Sunday visit day.

153
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,890
Switch?

154
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,890
You guys are so lucky.

155
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,900
Anyway, I'm going.
Eat your food, okay?

156
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,900
-Don't sleep in too long.
-Okay~.

157
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,940
Okay, I'm going then.

158
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,940
See you later~.

159
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,950
Time to start the job exploration.

160
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,950
If we follow Marumo,
we'll get to Akebono Office Supplies.

161
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,950
Make sure he doesn't notice us.

162
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,950
-Roger.
-Tomoki, let's go.

163
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,970
He's buying something.

164
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,980
If this goes in on the first try,

165
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,980
Kana-san and I will get closer.

166
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:03,000
That was practice. Just practice.

167
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
We'll get closer.

168
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,010
Ah~ Seriously.

169
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:15,010
-Really.
-He stinks.

170
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:18,010
-Oh, crap.
-He's running. Tomoki, let's go.

171
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,010
Roger.

172
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,020
We're gonna lose Marumo.

173
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,020
Don't worry, he'll be back.

174
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:30,020
Huh? Where did it go? Huh?

175
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:33,020
Why now of all times.

176
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:43,040
-Did you see which button?
-Perfect.

177
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,040
That was close.

178
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,050
We're finally here.

179
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:56,050
-Good morning.
-How do we go in?

180
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,050
What should we do?

181
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,990
Tomoki, let's go.

182
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Where does Marumo work?

183
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:31,010
Not here, huh?

184
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:48,030
-Is Marumo there?
-Found him.

185
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:53,040
He's studying hard. He's great, isn't he?

186
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,040
Ah, yes.
Yes, I'm very sorry.

187
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,980
What happened?
Looks like Marumo's getting scolded.

188
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,980
Poor Marumo.

189
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Why are they here.

190
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Wait, Takagi-san.
Where are you going all of a sudden?

191
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,010
-Just to the bathroom.
-What?

192
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,970
Hey, guys.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

193
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,980
What are you guys doing?

194
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,980
We're doing the job exploration.

195
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,990
Did you follow me?

196
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,990
Don't be reckless, exploration team.

197
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,000
But that's our homework and we wanted to see you at work.

198
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Hey, hide.

199
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Good morning.

200
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,010
What should I do with these.

201
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,010
We're sorry. We'll go home now.

202
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:48,010
It's not that simple.
I can't let you guys go home alone.

203
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,020
You guys, come here. Come, come.

204
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,020
Light, light.

205
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,970
Listen, guys.
Stay here for a while.

206
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,970
Okay, got it.

207
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:11,970
I'll come back first chance I get and take you home.

208
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,970
Hang in there until I come, okay?

209
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,980
Seriously, please don't leave this room.

210
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,980
Okay, we'll do our best.

211
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,980
Okay. Later.

212
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,990
What took you so long?

213
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,000
Oh, I'm having stomach problems.

214
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's an emergency.
Maybe I should go to the hospital.

215
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Yeah.
I'm going to the hospital just to be on the safe side.

216
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
-No, I'll take you.
-What's going on?

217
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,010
-Takagi-san has a stomach ache.
-Are you alright?

218
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,010
I can go by myself.
I'm a grown man, you know.

219
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,010
No, shouldn't someone go with you?

220
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,010
But there aren't any hospitals close by.

221
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,010
-Isn't it an emergency?
-Huh? No...well...

222
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:58,020
Oh, it feels like it's settling down.

223
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,020
What was it?
I'm alright. Thanks.

224
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,990
Must've been just my imagination.
I'm sorry.

225
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,860
-Are you sure?
-Are you alright?

226
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,860
I'm fine. Sorry.

227
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,870
Oh, that's right.
I have one apology visit to make.

228
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,870
Were you scheduled for a visit today, Takagi-kun?

229
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:25,880
I took a call from a customer this morning who sounded really mad.

230
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,880
Oh.

231
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,880
Oh, then I'll go with you.
I have

232
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,890
-one visit to make too.
-You.

233
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,890
You've been trying to follow me no matter what, huh?

234
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,890
What? Don't you have to go?
-Never mind. Come here for a minute.

235
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,890
What? What is it?

236
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,890
Come here. Let's talk. Come here.

237
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,900
Listen, you can't tell anyone, okay?

238
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,900
-Yes. What?
-Right now, the twins are...

239
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,900
I'm going to the stockroom.

240
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,900
Stockroom?
Wait, wait. Why are you going to the stockroom?

241
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,910
I thought I'd replenish the apology gifts.

242
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,910
I'll go then.
Since I'm in charge of the stockroom.

243
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:59,910
-Was there such a person in charge?
-Sure there is. You just don't remember.

244
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:03,910
I'll go, so don't worry.
Leave it to the person in charge of the stockroom.

245
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,950
Kaoru, Tomoki, let's go home.

246
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,960
You've got to be kidding me.

247
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,980
Onee-chan, I'm gonna pee in my pants.

248
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,980
I know, just wait a bit.

249
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,990
Hurry.

250
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:45,990
Let's go.

251
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Takagi-san, where are the apology gifts?
Takagi-san?

252
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,950
Tomoki, I found the restroom.

253
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:11,950
Oh yeah. Thank goodness.

254
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,960
Huh? What?

255
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,970
You're Takagi-san's...

256
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,980
Onee-chan, what do we do?

257
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,980
Tomoki, we're going to run.

258
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,980
Wait, wait.
Wait a minute.

259
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,980
Wait.

260
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,990
-Why are these children here?
-Marumo.

261
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,000
-Marumo.
-Marumo?

262
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Hey, hey, you guys.

263
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Kana-san.

264
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,940
Takagi-san, aren't these children your relative's children?

265
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,940
Takagi-kun, why did you bring the children?

266
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:12,950
-What's this about?
-Um..this is...

267
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,950
-I think it's too late for that.
-Do you think?

268
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,950
-Yes.
-Okay. He says this isn't gonna work anymore.

269
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,950
It's too late. Come on out.
Let's give up.

270
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,960
Go on, say your greeting.

271
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,960
I'm Sasakura Tomoki. I'm 7 years old.
-I'm Sasakura Kaoru, I'm 7 years old.

272
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,970
They're kids of my friend who passed away.

273
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:38,970
I took them in and they're living with me for the time being.

274
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:41,970
What? You're the guardian?

275
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,980
Takagi-san's raising the children?

276
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,980
Well, yes.

277
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:52,990
That's so typical of Takagi-kun.
People normally won't do such a thing, right?

278
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,990
-This man's not normal.
-But why did you bring them here?

279
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,990
Um...

280
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,990
We're the job exploration team.

281
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,990
Job exploration team?

282
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:04,930
We came to explore Marumo's job.

283
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:07,930
Does Marumo work hard?

284
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,930
Yes, he always works hard.

285
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm really sorry I didn't tell you about them.

286
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:29,010
I just couldn't bear

287
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,010
to see those two, who just lost their father, getting separated.

288
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:39,020
I wanted to let them be together at least until they could accept the fact.

289
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:44,020
I wasn't thinking ahead and it just turned out this way due to circumstances.

290
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:49,030
I was going to tell you, but

291
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:53,030
I couldn't get myself to say it.

292
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,040
You were surprised, weren't you?

293
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:05,040
I had no intention of deceiving you.
My feeling for you is real.

294
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:12,050
But in the end, I might as well have deceived you.

295
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,060
I'm really sorry.

296
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's so like Takagi-san.

297
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
What?

298
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:35,010
I don't know what lies ahead either, but

299
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:39,010
why don't we just continue dating for the time being?

300
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:42,020
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

301
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:49,020
Plus, we haven't even done any couple-like things yet.

302
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:54,030
Yes. Really, thank you.

303
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:57,030
Thank you too.

304
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,040
Oh, shoot.

305
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,040
I'll be right back after I take the kids home.

306
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,040
I'll call you soon.

307
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,050
Hey, you two. Come on, we're going home.

308
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,050
Lunch. What do you want for lunch?

309
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,050
-Hm~. Hamburger.
-Hamburger.

310
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:16,050
Okay, hamburger it is.

311
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,990
-Sorry it took so long.
-Where are the twins?

312
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,990
I took them home.

313
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,000
I was fixing their lunch and kinda lost track of time.

314
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm really sorry.

315
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Really.
Why didn't you tell us?

316
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
About the twins.

317
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,010
We would've cooperated if we knew.

318
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,010
I couldn't inconvenience you with my personal situation.

319
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:42,010
You're wrong if you think you can do it all by yourself.

320
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,010
Make sure you tell us if you need help, okay?

321
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:47,020
Thank you.
I'm sorry.

322
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,020
I'll cooperate too.
Besides, the twins were so cute.

323
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:53,020
Don't be fooled.
They could be quite the rascals.

324
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,020
Look, they even came to the office on their own.

325
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:00,030
Sorry for causing a commotion.

326
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:04,030
It's unheard of.

327
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:08,040
But you look somewhat relieved.

328
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,040
Well, we're all working together anyway

329
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,040
so secrets just get in the way.

330
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,040
It's a good thing we found out.

331
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,980
Oh, that's right, Takagi-kun.

332
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,990
Yes?

333
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,990
About the proposal for Ka-ke Run Run.

334
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,990
Yes, what about it?

335
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:33,000
I showed it to Product Development

336
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
and got a pretty good response.
Product Development?

337
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It's not our standard product, but they were quite interested.

338
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's a good opportunity.
Why don't you polish up your proposal a bit?

339
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:50,010
Here you go, Kujira-yu Bowl.

340
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:53,010
Itadakima~su.

341
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:59,020
-Yum.
-Really? I'm glad.

342
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,020
-Here.
-Oh, thanks.

343
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,030
What, everyone found out?

344
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,030
Yes, the whole office at once. 

345
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:10,030
What?
So what are you gonna do about her?

346
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:15,050
Of course we're gonna keep on dating.

347
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:16,970
-Is she gonna be alright?
-Frankly,

348
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,970
I thought we were done.

349
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:22,980
But Kana-san brought it up and said let's continue.

350
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:29,990
She said we haven't done any couple-like things yet.

351
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,990
-She said that?
-Yes.

352
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:34,990
She...how should I put it...has a big heart

353
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:37,990
and is very mature, and wonderful.

354
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:40,000
And, I really like her.

355
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
There he goes again.

356
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Sorry.

357
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,960
-We're home.
-We're home.

358
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:57,970
What?
What are you doing, Mook?

359
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:01,970
Give it here.
You...what are you doing?

360
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,980
Is that Kaoru's slippers?

361
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,980
No.
Look, they're too big for you, right?

362
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,980
-Then are they Marumo's?
-No, I said.

363
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,980
I don't wear these flowery things.

364
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,990
These are special ones for Kana-san.

365
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,990
Kana-san? Is Kana-san coming?

366
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,990
Of course she'll be coming.

367
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,990
No one else is wearing slippers.

368
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:26,000
We don't need them. The soles of our feet are dirty already anyway.

369
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
But Kana-san's a lady.

370
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Ladies have to protect their feet.

371
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
But Aya-chan don't wear slippers when she comes here.

372
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,010
Is Aya-chan a lady?
What is she?

373
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:41,010
Well, whatever. Anyway, these are Kana-san's slippers.

374
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:44,020
You'd better not touch them, okay?

375
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,020
Kana-san...

376
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,950
Oh, it's a call from Kana-san.

377
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,950
Fancy her calling me at this moment.

378
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,960
-Hello?
-Takagi-san?

379
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,970
Kana-san, what's up?

380
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,970
Takagi-san, are you free this Sunday?

381
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,970
-Sunday?
-Sunday?

382
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,970
Of course I'm free.

383
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:10,980
Good.
Then shall we go out?

384
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,980
Of course. Let's go out.

385
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,980
Go out?
Marumo, are you going out on Sunday?

386
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:20,990
-Sh~sh~sh~.
-Maybe a movie?

387
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,990
Um..I'm talking with Kana-san. It's got nothing to do with you guys.

388
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,990
I want to go on a picnic.
I want to take obentou.

389
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:30,000
I told you already that this has nothing to do with you guys.

390
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
-Is something wrong?
-No, I'm sorry.

391
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
It's nothing.

392
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
What~ No fair.
I want to go on a picnic.

393
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,010
You're too noisy.
Be quiet, okay?

394
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:42,010
Be quiet.
Please be quiet. Okay?

395
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:44,010
Sorry about all this

396
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,010
commotion.
Sorry.

397
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:49,950
Where shall we go on Sunday?

398
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,950
Since the twins are looking forward to it too,

399
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,950
why don't all of us go out together?

400
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:57,960
No. No. That's alright. Really.

401
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,960
Let's do that.
The more the merrier.

402
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,970
Are you sure? Thanks.

403
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,970
Hey guys, we're going out on Sunday.

404
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,970
Yay~!

405
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,970
Sorry.

406
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:15,970
Please don't mind it.

407
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:18,970
Then I'll call you again.

408
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,990
Here you go.

409
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,000
Itadakimasu.

410
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Help yourself.

411
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Cute~.

412
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Of course it is since Kana-san made it for us.

413
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,020
-Sorry for making you go through the trouble.
-Not at all.

414
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,940
-Here.
-Yummy.

415
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,940
It's way different from the meals Marumo makes.

416
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,950
Marumo's meals are

417
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,950
like more brownish.

418
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,960
Gochisousama.

419
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,960
Are you alright?
Here you go.

420
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,960
It was delicious.

421
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,970
Marumo, let's play catch.

422
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,970
You two go ahead and play without me.

423
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,970
Come on, let's play.

424
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:25,980
We practiced by ourselves just like you told us to.

425
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,980
Get up.

426
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,980
Come on, we can do it now.

427
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,990
Really?
Kana-san, why don't you join us too?

428
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:37,990
Me too?

429
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,990
Okay, Kaoru, try throwing to me.

430
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:45,000
What was that. You're not even close.

431
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,970
Listen. Keep you face like this.
Look straight at the other guy's face.

432
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,840
Keep your arm like this. Aim it straight at the other person's chest. Got it?

433
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,840
-Yes, Coach.
-Alright.

434
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,840
Then throw it towards Kana-san.

435
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,840
Oh, that's pretty good.

436
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,850
Okay, Tomoki next. Try to catch.

437
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,850
Here it goes.

438
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,850
Oh, nice. Tomoki, nice.

439
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:11,860
That's good.

440
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,860
-I want to catch too.
-You do? Okay.

441
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,860
Here it goes, Kaoru.

442
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,860
Nice, nice. Kaoru nice.

443
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:24,870
Okay, Tomoki.
Tomoki, nice. Tomoki, nice.

444
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,930
You do that very well.

445
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,930
Since you made us lunch

446
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:58,940
how about having dinner with us at home?

447
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:04,940
But the twins are probably tired too, so we should call it a day.

448
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:08,950
They're totally fine. They have endless energy.

449
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,990
-We're back~.
-We back.

450
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,990
How was it?
Did you have fun at the picnic?

451
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,990
It was a lot of fun.

452
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:27,990
Aya-chan, I'll give you these.

453
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,990
Oh, thanks.

454
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:33,000
What? Wait.
Oh, but all these?

455
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
You guys brought back all those? From back there?

456
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
It's a present from our outing.

457
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,010
Oh, hello.

458
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:45,010
-Hello. Good evening.
-Good evening.

459
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:47,010
Okay, Kaoru, Tomoki. We're going up.

460
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:52,020
Aw~ I wanna eat down here.

461
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,020
Kana-san came to have dinner with us, you know.

462
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,020
Come on. Don't be like that.
Come on, come on.

463
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:59,020
-Okay.
-Let's go, Kana-san.

464
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:02,030
-Oh.
-What's wrong?

465
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:05,030
This. It's for Oyaji-san.
-Oh?

466
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,030
-Oh, thanks.
-Hey, Kaoru, hurry up.

467
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:11,040
-Okay, coming. Wait.
-Thanks.

468
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,040
Sorry, Sorry.
Kana-san, watch your steps.

469
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,060
Looks like it's going well, huh?

470
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,980
-We're home.
-We're home.

471
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,980
We're home.

472
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,980
Kana-san. Come in.
Come in, come in.

473
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:31,990
Wait. Just a minute please.

474
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,990
Please wear this, Kana-san.

475
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,990
I got it for this day.

476
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:38,000
Oh, for me?

477
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Yes. If you don't wear these, your feet will get all dirty.

478
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
-Yes, but I feel bad being the only one.
-It's alright, it's alright.

479
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,010
It's too late for us, so
please don't worry about us and wear them.

480
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:51,010
-She's so lucky.
-I'll make the dinner so

481
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:53,010
Kana-san, please come in and just rest.

482
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,010
-Okay, you guys help me.
-Aw~.

483
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:58,020
-No aw-ing.
-Okay~.

484
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,020
-Alright.
-What shall we make?

485
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,020
-See if we have any eggs.
-Oh? There aren't any.

486
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,020
-We don't have eggs.
-Excuse me.

487
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,020
Yes?

488
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,030
I think I'll leave after all.

489
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:10,030
What, you're leaving?

490
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:13,030
Yes, it's getting late too.

491
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:18,970
-You're leaving?
-Yes. I'll see you again. Bye.

492
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:20,970
-Bye bye.
-Bye bye.

493
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:23,970
Kana-san...

494
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:43,990
You okay with that?

495
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Go after her. Act like a man, will you?

496
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,020
Kana-san.

497
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:18,030
Is something wrong?

498
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,970
Oh, sorry.
The room was pretty messy, wasn't it?

499
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:27,970
I should've cleaned it better.

500
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:33,980
Maybe we shouldn't have brought those guys with us after all.

501
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,980
I think I relied too much on your kindness.

502
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,980
I'm sorry.

503
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:45,990
Why are you apologizing?

504
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:53,000
I don't think it's going to work.

505
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I know I'm the one who said

506
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
let's keep on dating for the time being, but

507
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,010
I realized it might be difficult after all.

508
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:06,010
What? No, it won't be difficult at all.

509
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:09,010
If you're concerned about the twins, I can ask the folks downstairs to watch them,

510
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:11,020
and even if they're left alone, Kaoru's

511
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:14,020
very mature for her age.

512
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:18,960
So why don't we leave it as is for now?

513
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,960
That's what I thought at first too.

514
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,970
For the time being, we'll just date normally,

515
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:29,970
like watching movies and going to karaoke.

516
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,970
Movies. Movies will be great.

517
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:33,970
Let's go next time.
I'll leave the twins downstairs.

518
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:37,970
I'd like to go to karaoke too.
I'm surprisingly good at it.

519
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:45,980
I realized after spending the day with you all today.

520
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:50,990
When Takagi-san was with the twins,

521
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:54,990
you looked like their real dad to me.

522
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:56,990
I'm not doing as much as you think.

523
00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:00,000
I just took them in on the spur of the moment

524
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,000
and although I'm taking care of them, it's like I have no choice.

525
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,010
You praise them and scold them without holding anything back.

526
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:14,010
You're like a real family.

527
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,010
Well, not really.

528
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,950
Then I felt that

529
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:20,950
dating "for the time being" was not the solution.

530
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:22,950
That's...that's not true.

531
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:25,960
Once I decided that wasn't the solution,

532
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:30,960
frankly, I knew I wouldn't fit in there.

533
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,960
It'll be alright. Today too, we spent the day together.

534
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:40,970
To me, family is something that should be

535
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:43,980
built slowly, from the beginning.

536
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,980
Well, yes, I understand that, but...

537
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:50,980
Even if we continued to date,

538
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,990
later on

539
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:57,990
I'm afraid I might wish

540
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:01,990
that those children weren't here.

541
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I don't want to be like that.

542
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Then, I can send them back to their relatives...

543
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:32,950
I guess it's not going to work after all.

544
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,960
I'm sorry.

545
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,980
Welcome.

546
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:09,990
Takagi-san?
What's wrong?

547
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,940
Kana-san left.

548
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,940
What?

549
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:26,940
I've liked Kana-san for a long time.

550
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,940
It's been like many years, you know.

551
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:35,950
I persevered and finally got to date her.

552
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,960
Did something happen?

553
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,960
I got dumped.

554
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,960
What?

555
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:54,970
She thinks a family is something that should be built from the very beginning.

556
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,980
I know that too.

557
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:15,990
To meet a girlfriend normally, to fall in love and work normally.

558
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:23,930
To get married normally and be happy.

559
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:32,940
I used to think that was the natural progression of things too.

560
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:43,960
Ah~. It would've worked out if those guys weren't here.

561
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,960
-Takagi-san.
-Aya.

562
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,960
Anyway, have a drink.

563
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:08,980
I... I

564
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,980
almost said it.

565
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:16,990
That I was going to take them back.

566
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:24,930
I'm disgusted with myself.

567
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,940
But you didn't, did you?

568
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,940
How can I say that.

569
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:48,950
I can't even imagine such a thing either.

570
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,980
Mook, come.
Come here.

571
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:19,980
So Mook, you're the guest.
Sit there and listen to us, okay?

572
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,990
Job exploration team, gather.

573
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,990
-Roger.
-Hey, hey. What are you standing on.

574
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:29,990
-Oh, sorry, but...
-No but's.

575
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:32,000
I'm sorry.

576
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
What do you guys have in your hands?

577
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Our report on the job exploration.

578
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,010
We got a gold star for it
and we wanted to read it to you

579
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:44,010
so we were practicing.

580
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:46,010
So that's what you were doing.

581
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:49,010
But you shouldn't stand on the table.

582
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,020
Let me hear it then.

583
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,020
Sit there then.

584
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:04,030
"Marumo's job is bunbougu-ya-san."

585
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:08,030
"He leaves the house at 7:50 every morning."

586
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:11,040
"On the way, he drinks coffee to get his energy."

587
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,040
"He's not good at throwing away the empty can,

588
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,060
but he doesn't give up until it goes into the trash can."

589
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:20,980
"Marumo's job at the company

590
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:24,980
is to study and get scolded."

591
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:29,990
"When he answers the phone, Marumo does his best to apologize."

592
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:31,990
"He apologizes many times."

593
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,990
"But he still gets scolded."

594
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:39,000
"That's why I think I'll apologize with him next time."

595
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Study and get scolded.
What kind of a job is that.

596
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Trade places now.

597
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:53,010
"Marumo also has another job."

598
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:58,020
"He has a job to make our dinner when he comes home from work."

599
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,020
"The meals that Marumo makes

600
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,020
are always brownish and salty and delicious."

601
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,020
"When he doesn't go to work and has a day off,

602
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:07,020
he also does the laundry and sewing."

603
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,030
"But he's lousy at his job of cleaning the house,

604
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:14,030
so Marumo and Kaoru and Tomoki all have dirty feet."

605
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:16,030
"The job at Akebono Offices Supplies is like a father's,

606
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:18,970
and the job at home is like a mother's."

607
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:21,970
"I thought he must have his hands full with both jobs."

608
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:23,970
"I want to say thank you to Marumo

609
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:27,980
for working so many jobs."

610
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,980
"When I grow up

611
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,980
I want to work many jobs like Marumo."

612
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,980
"The end."

613
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
But I don't consider it my job to make you guys' meals, you know.

614
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,010
-It's not?
-No, it's not.

615
00:41:55,010 --> 00:42:00,010
What should we do? We made a mistake.

616
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:06,010
Marumo, why are you crying?
Is it because we made a mistake?

617
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:14,020
Thanks, exploration team.

618
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:23,970
Really, thanks.

619
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:30,970
Marumo.

620
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,980
I'm happy for you.

621
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:46,990
Thanks. Thanks.

622
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:08,010
House cleaning must be done properly!

623
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:13,010
Keep the soles of your feet clean!

624
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:22,960
Bye bye, slippers!

625
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,960
-Okay, we're gonna clean the house now.
-Bye bye slippers?

626
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,970
Why bye bye?

627
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:32,970
We don't need fancy things like slippers in our house.

628
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:36,970
-Aren't you throwing it away?
-Huh?

629
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:38,980
What...what do you mean?
I'm throwing it away...now.

630
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:44,980
Throw it away. Yeah.
Throw it away. 

631
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:51,990
Okay, that's it.
This is the way it should be.

632
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:53,990
Okay, guys, let's begin.

633
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:55,990
Roger.

634
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Here we go.

635
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Okay. Mook, you do it too.

636
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Why are you coming to me?

637
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:15,010
Do it right, from corner to corner, side to side.

638
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:17,030
Here we go.
On your mark.

639
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,950
Get set.
Go.

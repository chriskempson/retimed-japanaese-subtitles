1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
[After Daddy died,
Kaoru got separated from Tomoki.]

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
[But thanks to Daddy's friend, Marumo,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
we got to live together again.]

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,010
-I'm Takagi Mamoru.
-Takagi Marumo.

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,010
[The dog's with us too.]

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,010
Daddy's not here anymore!

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:23,020
[Marumo's scary when he's mad,
but he's really very kind.]

8
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,020
[Kaoru and Tomoki are doing fine now.]

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,020
Goma shio.

10
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,030
Don't forget the canned mackerel too.

11
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,030
What~!

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,030
I see.
"You're the worst."

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,040
-That's what he said?
-Yes.

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,040
"You're the worst."
Out of the blue, the dog said.

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,040
[You're the worst.]

16
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,040
[What?]

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,050
You hear a voice you shouldn't be hearing.

18
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,050
That's auditory hallucination, a type of hallucination.

19
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,070
Auditory hallucination? But why all of a sudden?

20
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,990
Even healthy people can experience it temporarily.

21
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:10,000
For example, when they feel stressed or a sense of loss.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
[What happened to you suddenly.]

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
[Why aren't you saying anything.]

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,010
In your case,

25
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:24,010
you may be hearing what you're feeling in your heart.

26
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,010
-Your subconscious feeling is taking the form of a voice.

27
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,020
Does that mean the one who said "You're the worst"

28
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,020
is me?

29
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,020
Yes.
It means that's a possibility.

30
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:39,030
I see. So that's what it was.

31
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,030
There's no need to rush.

32
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,030
Let's treat it slowly, over time.

33
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,030
Yes.

34
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,890
No, Tomoki.
You can't put on a sticker.

35
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,890
This isn't our house.

36
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,890
Alright.

37
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,900
Doesn't this dog look like Mook*?
His hair's shaggy. (*character in children's show)

38
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,910
Yeah, he does.
Let's name him Mook then.

39
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,910
You're Mook from today.

40
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,920
-Mook.
-Shaggy hair.

41
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,920
He feels good.

42
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,920
What do you think, huh?

43
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,920
It looks super delicious.

44
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,930
Thanks for letting me take the morning off.

45
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,930
Is your cold better now?

46
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,930
Cold?

47
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,930
Oh...yes. I went to the hospital
so I'm feeling much better.

48
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,940
-Don't spread it around.
-Really, please don't.

49
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,940
I'm going to a goukon* today.
(*matchmaking party)

50
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,980
Goukon again?
You really like that, don't you?

51
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,980
-Hello, this is Takagi.
-Hello, this is Sasakura.

52
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,980
Mamoru-kun,
do you have time right now?

53
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,990
I'm really sorry for imposing on you.

54
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,990
If they're too much trouble, I'll come get them right way.

55
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:20,990
No, not at all. I'm the one who brought them
home on the spur of the moment.

56
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll be there to pick them up on Sunday.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'll admonish them properly this time.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
-Alright.
-Here's some change of clothes for the kids.

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,010
The top is Kaoru's and the bottom is Tomoki's.
Should be enough for 3 days.

60
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:40,010
There's no other way, right?

61
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:45,010
I mean, some way for those kids to be together.

62
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:51,020
I talked to my sister again, but

63
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:55,030
like we said before, it's hard for either one of us to take both of them.

64
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,030
Does that mean they have
no choice but to live separately?

65
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,970
What about their mother?

66
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,970
Were you able to contact Ayumi-san?

67
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,980
I called her cell phone,
but the number's no longer in use.

68
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:15,980
In any case, I wasn't going to notify her about
the funeral, even if I was able to contact her.

69
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,990
-But still, to those kids...
-She left home as if she was running away from them.

70
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,990
She abandoned those kids who were still babies.

71
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,990
Granted, she may have been suffering from parental neurosis, but

72
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,990
I can never forgive her.

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yes. You're right. Yes.

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Sorry for taking so long.

75
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,010
Tashiro-san from Sales called.

76
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,010
-Okay, I'll call him back later.
-Yes, I agree.

77
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,020
We're very sorry.

78
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,020
-Yes, good bye.
-A complaint?

79
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,020
Yes, it was about the mechanical pencil.

80
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,020
He said his hands get dirty when replacing the lead

81
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,030
so do something about it.

82
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,960
What?  Do we have to apologize for something like that too?

83
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,960
Isn't he just a complainer?
Probably has nothing better to do.

84
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,970
Things can be triggered by complaints.

85
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:11,970
A minor complaint may lead to a hit merchandise.

86
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:16,980
Customers' opinions are a mountain of gold.
We should cherish them.

87
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,980
Takagi-kun, what happened to the report

88
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,990
-about that ball point pen?
-I'm working on it, but

89
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,990
I'm stuck on the improvement plan.

90
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,990
"The cap is not a ear cleaner."

91
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,990
We can't very well write a disclaimer like that.

92
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,990
There's no end to it once you start writing disclaimers like that.

93
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,000
Why don't we just

94
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
make the cap an actual ear cleaner.

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
-What?
-What are you saying, Takagi-kun?

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
This isn't the time to be joking.

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You're right.
Sorry.

98
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,010
What's this?

99
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,020
What's a child's sock doing here?

100
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,020
It was in Takagi-san's area.

101
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,020
Takagi-san, do you have that kind of kinky taste?
No, that's not it.

102
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,960
-Disgusting.
-No, listen, th...this is...

103
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,960
this is...this is...you know, that.
Oh, iron cover.

104
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,960
-That's baseball.
-Oh, I mean golf...for golf...

105
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,970
You know, that cover is pricier than I expected.

106
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,970
Look, this is for the No. 6 iron.

107
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,970
Oh, that won't work...

108
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:23,970
Yes, yes, A..Akebono Office Supplies,
Customer Service.

109
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,980
Don't move, Mook.

110
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,990
Isn't it a good thing Marumo works for a stationery store?

111
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,990
There's a lot of notebooks too.

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Marumo said he's here.
0210...

113
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,010
You're eating ice cream.

114
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,010
-Do you want some too?
-No. That's

115
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:01,950
-Marumo's ice cream.
-I can't eat it?

116
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,950
Marumo won't have any left for himself.

117
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,950
What should I do?
Will he get mad at me?

118
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,960
Tomoki, should we go buy one?

119
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,960
Huh?
But we're not supposed to leave the house.

120
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,960
Besides, what about the money?

121
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,960
That's right. Tomoki, take that out.

122
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,960
That?

123
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,970
Found it.

124
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,980
This one looks good.

125
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,980
We're here to buy Marumo's ice cream,
not Tomoki's, remember?

126
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,980
Oh, yeah.

127
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Shall we help?

128
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
We'll push.

129
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Oh, thank you.

130
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,020
Looks like I bought too much.

131
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:05,950
Thank you.

132
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,950
So, you're twins.

133
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,950
I'm the older sister and Tomoki's the younger brother.

134
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,960
You know, it's strange. We sneeze together too.

135
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,960
Is that right? You must be very close.

136
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,970
Oh, this is fine here.

137
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,970
Thank you so much.

138
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,970
Do you know your way home?

139
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,970
Bye bye.

140
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,980
-Bye bye.
-Bye bye.

141
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,980
Bye bye.
Thank you.

142
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:42,980
Take care.  Be careful.
Thank you.

143
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,990
Oh no.  Which way was it?

144
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,990
This way?

145
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,940
Was it this way?

146
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,950
Onee-chan.

147
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,960
Don't cry. Let's try that way.

148
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,960
Hey, kids. What's wrong?

149
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,970
Wait a minute.

150
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,980
Pardon me? Marumo?
We don't have anyone by that name.

151
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,980
I'll take it.

152
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,980
It's alright.

153
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,990
Hello, this is Takagi.
Yes.

154
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,990
Oh, is that right?

155
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:04,000
I understand. I'll be there right away.
I'm sorry. I'm sor...

156
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm sorry, but I'd like to leave early today.

157
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,010
What.  You don't feel well after all?

158
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,010
Um..no...

159
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,010
Yes, that's right.

160
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:22,010
Well, it's only 30 minutes till quitting time, so I guess it's alright.

161
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,020
You came in late and you're leaving early?

162
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,020
I'm really sorry.
Excuse me for leaving first.

163
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,020
Bye.

164
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,040
Oh, Takagi-san...th-that's...

165
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,040
This..this is...
this is...um...you know..that.

166
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,050
It's a necessity when washing your face.

167
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,050
That's it.

168
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:00,050
See you later.
Bye.

169
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,990
The phone call just now was from the police.

170
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,990
-What?
-What did he do?

171
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:10,000
He does have kinky taste after all.

172
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
-Gross
-So that's why he can't get married.

173
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,010
-Hello.
-Hello.

174
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:26,010
2nd Floor, was it?

175
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,010
Yes. Thanks.

176
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,020
-Takagi-san.
-Yes.

177
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,030
Don't move, okay?

178
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,030
Huh?

179
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,030
Makimura-san?

180
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,040
Here.

181
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,040
It was on the back of your suit.

182
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,050
Oh, thanks.
How did it get there?

183
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,980
You must like cute things, huh?

184
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,980
See you later then.

185
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,990
Those munchkins.

186
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Didn't I tell you not to go out?

187
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Do you know what I had to go through to get off early?

188
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Plus, what's this sticker.  Don't go around
sticking these things wherever.

189
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,010
Thanks to you guys, I got laughed at by Makimura-san.

190
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,010
Now, now, calm down, Dad.

191
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,010
What?
I'm not their father.

192
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:35,010
-Seriously.
-Then who are you?

193
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:40,020
-Oh, a relative?
-Well, I'm not a relative either.

194
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,020
When I asked for their guardian's name,

195
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,020
they told me to call this toll free number.

196
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:48,030
Well, for the time being, I'm their guardian.

197
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:51,030
I'm taking care of them temporarily

198
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,030
because they ran away from their uncle's house.

199
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,030
Um...what I mean is...

200
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,040
it's the kind of running away from home
that you don't have to worry about.

201
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,040
Um...wait...no...

202
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,060
Please believe me.
I swear it's true.

203
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,980
There's been a few eyewitness
reports recently around here

204
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,980
that there's a suspicious person
who's been approaching children.

205
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,980
You misunderstand.
I didn't kidnap them or anything.

206
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,990
Then you must know a lot about these children, right?

207
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,990
How old are they?

208
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,990
Of course I know how old they are.

209
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,990
-Right?
-Please tell me.

210
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,990
Come on.
This is too much.

211
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,990
Please tell me.

212
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
5 years old?
Bu~.

213
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What's their favorite food?

214
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,010
Hamburger?

215
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:40,010
-It's zaru soba*. -That's so old-folkish.
(*cold noodles with dipping sauce)

216
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,020
No, no, no, no.

217
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,020
I'm not...I'm not...

218
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,990
-Ah...finally released.
-Good thing he finally believed you, huh?

219
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:34,990
Whose fault was it
that I was suspected in the first place.

220
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:38,990
Thank god Sasakura's brother answered his phone.

221
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,990
What a major pain.

222
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Why did you guys go out?
Tell me.

223
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,010
What's that? What is it? What is it?

224
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:57,010
Hey, let me see..
Give it here, give it to me...what is it?

225
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,010
What's this?

226
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:12,030
I ate up Marumo's ice cream so

227
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:15,030
we went to buy the same ice cream.

228
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,030
You mean the ice cream in the freezer?

229
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:21,040
Wait a minute.
I was really looking forward to eating that.

230
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,040
I'm sorry.

231
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,970
Not only that, this one's slightly different.

232
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:28,980
The one I like is premium vanilla, not vanilla.

233
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,980
We didn't have enough money.

234
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,980
Money?

235
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,990
Come to think of it,
where did you guys get the money?

236
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,990
Did you have some?

237
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I had the 100 yen Daddy put in here.

238
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Huh?

239
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,010
He told us to use it when we are in trouble.

240
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:02,010
Tomoki had 100 yen and Kaoru had 100 yen too.

241
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:05,010
But we still couldn't buy
the ice cream Marumo likes.

242
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:08,020
I'm sorry.

243
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:15,020
What? What are you doing?

244
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:19,020
Don't spend your precious money on something like this.

245
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:24,030
If you like ice cream, just say so.

246
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:31,970
Seriously, what am I gonna do with you guys.

247
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,980
Wanna go buy some ice cream on the way home?

248
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,980
What?  Can we?

249
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,990
-We're home
-We're home.

250
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Yeah, that's more like it.
Dogs should say woof.  That's right.

251
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:06,010
-Hey, what about the ice cream?
-We'll have it for our snack tomorrow.

252
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,010
Okay, I'll put it away in the freezer then.

253
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,020
Oh, that's right.

254
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,020
-Should we write our names on the ice cream?
-Why?

255
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,020
So that you won't ever eat my ice cream again.

256
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,020
Oh.

257
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:24,960
We can read our name,
but can't write it.

258
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,970
Are you serious?
I guess I have no choice.

259
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:33,970
I'll write an example, so you guys practice, okay?

260
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,970
Here it goes.

261
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:41,980
This is KAORU.

262
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,980
And this is TOMOKI.

263
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:50,990
And I'm MAMORU.

264
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:57,990
What about SASAKURA?
Sasakura? This is SASAKURA.

265
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:04,000
SASAKURA.  There.

266
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
SASAKURA.  There, like this.

267
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Okay, got it.

268
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:16,010
Oh, we decided to name that dog Mook.

269
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:19,010
Write Mook's name on his food too.

270
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:23,020
-Mook?
-Doesn't he look like Mook?

271
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,950
No you can't.

272
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,960
We're not going to keep him
so there's no need to give him a name.

273
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,960
He may be Mook now, but

274
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,960
once his owner is found,
he might have a different name, right?

275
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,970
Names aren't something

276
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,970
you give without much thought.

277
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:41,970
Your names, too, were given to you by your daddy,

278
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,970
who put a lot of thought into them,

279
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:46,980
along with lots of good wishes.

280
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,980
Anyway, he's not Mook. He's dog.

281
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,980
-No~ He's Mook.
-Dog.

282
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,990
-Mook.
-He's dog.

283
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Can't you sleep?

284
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:24,030
It's me.  Me.

285
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:27,950
Mook? You can talk? That's amazing.

286
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,950
Of course I can.

287
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:34,960
Let's play a lot tomorrow.
So go to sleep.

288
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,960
Okay, I'll go to sleep. Good night.

289
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
-Food.
-Food.

290
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
-Food.

291
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,010
Did he talk?

292
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:10,020
Just my imagination?

293
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,020
Let's play, Marumo.

294
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:16,020
You don't have to work on Saturday, do you?
Wake up.

295
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,020
-Wake up.
-Wait, wait, wait.

296
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,030
It's a rule to sleep until past noon on days off.

297
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:33,040
Look, you guys go play somewhere.
Like a park.

298
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:38,040
But we don't know where anything is.
We're gonna get lost again.

299
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,040
Mook.

300
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,990
Marumo, let's play.

301
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,990
This way, this way.

302
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,990
Don't worry about me.
The two of you go play.

303
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,010
Onee-chan, let's play catch.

304
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,010
But Tomoki's really bad at it.

305
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:12,010
You couldn't even catch once
when you played with Daddy.

306
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:15,010
But I can do it now.

307
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:18,020
Here it goes.

308
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,020
I can't catch that.

309
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:26,020
What are they doing?
What did Sasakura teach them?

310
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,020
Hey Mook, wait.

311
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:35,030
Who, me?

312
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,040
Okay, okay.
I guess I have no choice.

313
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,980
You guys don't even have the fundamentals right. Listen, okay?

314
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,980
Never take your eyes off the ball.

315
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,990
Even if you get scared,
don't close your eyes.

316
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,990
Okay, here it goes, Tomoki.

317
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I told you to watch the ball.

318
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
-Never mind.
-That's not for you to say.

319
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,010
Okay. Next, Kaoru, here it goes.

320
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:21,010
What was that?

321
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:25,020
You guys, we're not here to fetch balls, you know.

322
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,020
Here it goes, Marumo.

323
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,020
[Here it goes, Mamoru.]

324
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:41,030
What are you doing, Marumo?

325
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:43,030
Oh, sorry, sorry.

326
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:46,040
Alright, you'd better catch this time.

327
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,060
Yeah, bring it on.

328
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:10,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Listen. Pets aren't allowed at our house.

329
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
If the landlord finds out, he's gonna get mad,
so go up quietly, understand?

330
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
-Okay!
-Keep it down.

331
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.

332
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:30,020
We're home.

333
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:34,020
-We're home.
-We're home.

334
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,030
Alright, let's fix something to eat.

335
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,030
-What do you want?
-Hamburger.

336
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,030
What~?
You guys like hamburger?

337
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,030
Takagi-san.

338
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,970
Yes. Yes.
You guys hide..hide.

339
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,970
Where?
Huh? Huh? Huh? Where?

340
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,970
Take your shoes with you.

341
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,970
Coming.
Just a minute.

342
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,980
-Did you want something?
-A little while ago

343
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,980
-I thought I saw a dog.
-A dog?

344
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,980
It must have been your imagination.

345
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,990
You don't have a dog, do you?

346
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,990
I don't have anything, don't have anything.

347
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,990
There he is.

348
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:19,000
Oh, this, um...
I can explain .

349
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Is it a stuffed animal?

350
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Huh?

351
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,010
Ah, y-y-yes.
It's a stuffed animal.

352
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,010
Mook, hurry, come here.

353
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:35,010
It's made really well.
It looks so real.

354
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:40,020
Wait, what...is it moving?

355
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,020
-It was over there just now.
-Wait...

356
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,020
It's just a stuffed animal, you know?
Isn't it just your imagination?

357
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:48,040
I don't hardly think so. It was there...huh?

358
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,960
Why?

359
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,960
Something's definitely strange.
Excuse me.

360
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,960
Wait, wait a minute.
How can you...without permission.

361
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:06,980
Takagi-san, what in the world are you doing in here?

362
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,980
No, it's not what you think.

363
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:18,990
That's not what you think either.

364
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,990
It's best you don't go there.
It's dangerous...

365
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,990
Two oyako-don* up.
(*chicken and egg bowl)

366
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Here you go.

367
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Wow, I'm gonna eat Tako*-san for the first time. (*octopus)

368
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Is that right?

369
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,010
Tako-san's delicious.

370
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:49,010
Isn't it, though? How did you know? I made that.

371
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:51,010
-It's good.
-It's good.

372
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:54,020
Oh, next time
I'll make you Kani*-san. (*crab)

373
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,020
Come on over again, okay?

374
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,020
Those kids are so young but

375
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,020
had to go through a lot, haven't they?

376
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:05,030
They're such cute good kids.

377
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,030
Say,

378
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,030
why don't you just keep them?

379
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,030
Hey, don't be so presumptuous.

380
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:14,040
But their relatives are so cruel.

381
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,040
To take the kids separately, when that time came.

382
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,040
You have to consider their circumstances too.

383
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,040
It's not easy to raise children.

384
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,050
You haven't even raised one, so don't talk like you know it all.

385
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:29,070
I'm saying this because I haven't, and don't ever intend to, raise one.

386
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,990
They could be like your grandkids, Dad,

387
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,990
so it's good for you too.
Plus, I have no desire to marry anymore.

388
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,990
What does that mean?

389
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,990
Are you saying that you're gonna remain single forever?

390
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,990
That has nothing to do with you anyway, Dad.

391
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:42,000
Excuse me, excuse me.
Excuse me.

392
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
The children will be picked up tomorrow.

393
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
In the first place, why did you come home suddenly?

394
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
What I do is my business.

395
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,010
Hey, hey,
calm down, both of you.

396
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:54,010
Let's chill out, shall we?

397
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:01,010
Ah~ I'm tired today.

398
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,030
-You want ice cream?
-Yeah.

399
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:19,030
It's good.

400
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:24,040
-Let me have some.
-No, you still have yours, Tomoki.

401
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,040
Oh, I do.

402
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,980
This notebook's pretty handy, isn't it?

403
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,980
Is this Tomoki's? Let's see.

404
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:36,980
What a terrible handwriting.

405
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,990
-Hey, this is CHICHIKURA.
-Huh?

406
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:45,990
You wrote the letters for SASA backwards.
(SA=さ; CHI=ち)

407
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:49,000
This spells CHICHIKURA.

408
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
No way. Chichikura?
He said Chichikura.

409
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,010
Don't be laughing at your own mistake.

410
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:01,010
Is this Kaoru's? Let's see.

411
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:10,020
Kaoru, you just practiced your first name?

412
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:15,020
-Because I won't be Sasakura soon.
-Huh?

413
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:18,030
When Uncle comes to get us tomorrow,
Kaoru's going to Auntie's house, right?

414
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,030
Then Kaoru's

415
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,030
going to be Auntie Endou's child, right?

416
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:29,030
Is that true, Marumo?

417
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:37,980
Is Onee-chan's name going to change?

418
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,980
We're not going to be together anymore?

419
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:52,990
-No, that can't be.
-There's nothing we can do.

420
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:55,000
Daddy's not here anymore.

421
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:10,010
What's wrong?

422
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:15,020
It's too good to eat at once,
so I'm saving the rest for tomorrow.

423
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,020
Me too. I'll eat the rest tomorrow.

424
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,010
So tiny.

425
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:20,010
They used to be like this.

426
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,020
[It's a good thing for the kids.]

427
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,960
[They've been together since they were born.]

428
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,960
[Even during sad times, they'll have each other.]

429
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:07,020
Thanks a lot for letting us impose on you.

430
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:10,020
We'll get going then.

431
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:21,040
Take care.

432
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,040
Marumo.

433
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,050
Marumo!

434
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:34,050
Marumo!
Marumo!

435
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:37,050
Marumo!

436
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:43,050
Marumo! Marumo!

437
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:15,020
Oh right, the dog's still here. What should I do?

438
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:22,030
Hey, shall we go look for someone who'll take you?

439
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,040
Are you really okay with this?

440
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,040
Huh?

441
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:44,050
[In your case, you may be hearing
what you're feeling in your heart.]

442
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:46,050
[Your subconscious feeling is taking the form of a voice.]

443
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:57,000
But I would've liked

444
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
to have seen them learn to catch the ball.

445
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,010
Me too.
Of course I would've liked that too.

446
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,030
Sasakura would've wanted to too.

447
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:03,000
[Daddy's gone, and I don't want to be separated from Tomoki too.]

448
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
[Don't be mean to Onee-chan.]

449
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,010
-[Takagi Marumo?]
-[It's Mamoru. Mamoru. What the heck's a Marumo?]

450
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:17,010
[Takagi Marumo.]

451
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:19,010
-[We're done with the bath.]
-[Hey, wait.

452
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:22,020
You're wet, you're wet.
Hold on, I said you're wet.]

453
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,020
[I'm scared.]

454
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:28,020
[It's not scary, it's not..
it's not scary]

455
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,020
[Are you alright?]

456
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:33,030
[It's okay to cry if you want to cry. Right?]

457
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:37,030
-[Right?]
-[Yes.]

458
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:40,030
[Let's play, Marumo.]

459
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:42,040
[What was that?]

460
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,040
[You guys, we're not here to fetch balls, you know.]

461
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,980
[Because I won't be Sasakura soon.]

462
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,980
[When Uncle comes to get us tomorrow,

463
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,980
Kaoru's going to Auntie's house, right?]

464
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:01,990
[Onee-chan, we can't be together anymore?]

465
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:09,000
[Marumo! Marumo!]

466
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,030
"Marumo, thanks for staying with us.
Chiyonara*" (*meant to be Sayonara)

467
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:47,030
What the heck is "Chiyonara."
(she wrote "chi" instead of "sa")

468
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,980
Those guys.

469
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,980
Marumo?

470
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,990
Marumo.

471
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:21,000
Marumo.
Marumo.

472
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Marumo!
Marumo!

473
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:41,020
What's wrong, Mamoru-kun?
Did we forget something?

474
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:45,020
No, um...

475
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:49,020
Um...

476
00:37:51,960 --> 00:38:01,960
When these two are together,
they're really cheerful and happy.

477
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:06,970
It's like, they're happy because they're together.

478
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:08,980
Are you still trying to tell me that they should stay together?

479
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:13,980
No, well, not exactly, but...

480
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:18,990
I was thinking if they could be together for a little bit longer.

481
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:21,990
I already said that was out of the question.

482
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:24,990
At least until they agree to it,

483
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:26,990
I'd like for them to be able to stay together.

484
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:31,000
You know there's no way we can do that.

485
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:38,010
Certainly, it takes a lot out of you and it could be tiring.

486
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:45,010
But since I met them,
even though it was only for a few days,

487
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:51,010
it seems I laughed and cried a lot
for the first time in a long time.

488
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:55,950
I've never felt like this before.

489
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,960
I wanted to spend more time with these kids.

490
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:08,970
I'm thinking about living with these kids.

491
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:11,970
What are you saying all of a sudden?

492
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:14,980
Do you realize what you're saying?

493
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,980
-Yes.
-They're not your children, you know.

494
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,980
They're not even related to you, you know.

495
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,980
Yes, I know.

496
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:24,990
Then I suggest you reconsider.

497
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:27,990
Even us relatives are struggling to deal with it,

498
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,990
so how can an unrelated person take on the burden.

499
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:31,990
It's not about the burden or whatever.

500
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:37,990
I don't know why.
It may not work out.

501
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,010
But I want to be watching over those two.

502
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:49,010
Like Sasakura was doing.

503
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:54,940
From now on, I want to do it in his place.

504
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:00,950
I want to stay with Marumo.

505
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,960
Me too.

506
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,980
Mook can stay with us too, can't he?

507
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,980
I guess I don't have a choice.

508
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,980
But we'll have to return him as soon as his owner's found.

509
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,980
We did it.

510
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:46,000
Can I keep on being Sasakura Kaoru?

511
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Of course.

512
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:57,010
You guys will always be Sasakura's kids.

513
00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:00,010
Sasakura Kaoru and Sasakura Tomoki

514
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:04,020
are precious names given to you by your dad, aren't they?

515
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:08,020
Really? Can we really have matching names with Daddy?

516
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,020
Yup.

517
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:19,030
From today on, this is your home.
You don't have to hold anything in.

518
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:26,040
So if you want to cry, you can cry.

519
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:30,040
But, but.

520
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
It's good.

521
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
It's goma shio.

522
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,010
Eat the fried egg too.
After all, I made it for you guys.

523
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:09,010
Oh, that's right.

524
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:20,020
This is important, so I'm writing it down.

525
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,040
"Kids will be kids."?

526
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:34,040
Yeah. This is your home.

527
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:38,050
Even though your dad and mom aren't here,
you don't have to feel uneasy.

528
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:41,050
Don't hold it in if you want to cry.

529
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:43,050
Don't hold it in even more if you want to laugh.

530
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:46,050
Kids will be kids. Okay?

531
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:57,000
Dogs will be dogs. Right?

532
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:10,010
Okite*.
(Rules/Code)

533
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:12,010
Okite?
Yeah.

534
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:17,020
Think of it as our promise so that we can live in harmony from now on.

535
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,020
-Can you abide by it?
-Okay.

536
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:23,020
-We'll abide by it.
-Okay, pinky promise then.

537
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:26,030
Oh, but Mook can't pinky promise.

538
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:29,030
I guess we have no choice.
We'll have to do it this way.

539
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:33,030
Okay, come here.

540
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,040
Come on, Mook.

541
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:43,040
Let's go!

542
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:49,070
Oh shoot. I have to go to work.

543
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:52,990
Before that, I'll stop by the municipal office

544
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:56,990
to change your address and report that you're living with me.

545
00:43:56,990 --> 00:44:00,990
Marumo, are we going to attend an elementary school around here?

546
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:05,000
-Elementary school?
-We're going to be in first grade this year.

547
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
What? Is that right? First grade?

548
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
How do you enroll in elementary school?

549
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,010
Don't know.

550
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:14,010
Well, anyway, I'll ask about that at the municipal office.

551
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:17,010
-I'm going.
-See you later.

552
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:22,020
Hey, hey.

553
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:27,020
What?
Give me a break, will ya?

554
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,020
Don't forget to register me too.

555
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:31,020
What! Register!

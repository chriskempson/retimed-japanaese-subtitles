1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,010
Go, go, let's go.
Let's go, Marumo.

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,010
Go, go, let's go...

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,020
Yay, thanks, Marumo.

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,020
Good job!

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,020
You guys, when you're at the pool,

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,020
you'd better listen to the lifeguard, you hear?

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,020
And don't forget to do warm-up exercise first.

8
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,030
-Alright.
-Okay.

9
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,030
1, 2, 3, 4.

10
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,030
-Not yet, not yet.
-5, 6, 7...

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,030
And your homework too.

12
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,030
If you don't get them done, the annual summer break

13
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,040
-homework hell will be waiting for you.
-Okay~.

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,040
Okay, then, I'm off to work.

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,040
You'd better strengthen your lung power, you Arafou*. (*around 40 years old)

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,050
Leave me alone.
Okay, I'm going.

17
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,050
See you later.

18
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,050
Aya-chan. Good morning.

19
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,060
Oh, good morning.
What happened?

20
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,060
I just inflated 2 swimming rings.

21
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,080
The kids say they're going to the pool.

22
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,000
If you don't mind,

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Aya-chan, can you watch them?

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Sure, I can do that.
I just bought a new swimsuit too.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
-Maybe I'll wear that.
-What? Aya-chan in a swimsuit?

26
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,010
Oh, I mean, um, that is...
They're only going

27
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:22,010
to the community pool so you don't have to wear your new swimsuit

28
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,020
and get all prettied up is what I mean.

29
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:28,020
What difference does it make.
Look, you're going to be late.

30
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,020
Oh. Thanks then.

31
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,030
Good morning, everyone.

32
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,040
-Good morning.
-Oh, Chief,

33
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,040
-good morning.
-How was your vacation?

34
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,040
We had a great time.

35
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,050
We went on a trip with my daughter and her family, but

36
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,050
it's the first time we went with our grandkid, so

37
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,050
I was so excited, I got carried away.

38
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,050
Here. Presents for everyone.

39
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,990
Thank you very much.

40
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:09,000
This may be for Rinka-chan?

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Oh, it's cute.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This color, this must be for Tami-san.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Won-won-wonderful~.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This must be for Mashima.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,010
C-cool~. I've been looking for something like this.

46
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,010
And this is mine.

47
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,010
I was looking for this...

48
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,010
I wonder where he went?

49
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:32,020
By the way, what are you doing for summer vacation?

50
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,020
Aren't you taking the kids somewhere?

51
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,020
Well, it's not cheap for a family of three to go anywhere.

52
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,030
What are you talking about. Now's about the only time they'd

53
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,030
-go on a trip with you.
-Pretty soon friends will come first

54
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,030
and they'll get busy with extracurricular activities.

55
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,030
Plus fathers can start getting on your nerves suddenly.

56
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,040
Really? But they're only in first grade.

57
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,040
If you keep on thinking you can go anytime,

58
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,040
you're going to end up not going at all.

59
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,050
Is that right? Trip, huh.

60
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:03,050
Excuse me~.

61
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,990
-Who's that?
-She's...um...

62
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,990
the insurance lady.
I advise you

63
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,990
not to make eye contact.
Seriously.

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Oh, we haven't met before, have we?

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm Shimada Hitomi with Happiness Life.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,010
-Hello, I'm Takagi.
-How old are you, Takagi-san?

67
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,010
Are you married? Any children?

68
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,010
Um....it's a delicate question, but I'm going to ask anyway. How much savings do you have?

69
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:37,020
I don't have a wife or savings.
But I have 2 kids in the first grade.

70
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,020
You're raising two children by yourself?

71
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,020
-Yes.
-Oh no. That's very worrisome.

72
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,020
Hitomi's extremely worried.

73
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,030
-Hitomi.
-School expenses can be very high, you know.

74
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,030
Education through college costs 5 million yen for public schools,

75
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,030
10 million for private.
Double that for two of them.

76
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,030
Which brings us to this first.

77
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,040
Educational Endowment Insurance?

78
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,980
How you prepare for the future now

79
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,980
will determine the children's future.

80
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,980
It's going to be too late if you don't watch out.
By the time you regret it, it's too late.

81
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,990
-The children's future?
-Yes, of course.

82
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,990
Ta-Takagi-san.
Excuse me, Takagi-san.

83
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,990
-Yes.
-Um...It's about time

84
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,990
-for the visit.
-Oh, yeah. That's right.

85
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:25,000
I'll be waiting~.

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Hello.

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The customer was calmer than I expected.

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm relieved.

89
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:39,010
Takagi-san, are you bothered by what that lady said earlier?

90
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,010
Kinda.

91
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,020
It's true, I never thought about

92
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,020
the children's future.

93
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:50,020
I don't even know how long I can be with them.

94
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,030
Mashima, what about you?

95
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,030
Is there something you're doing for your future?

96
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,970
I guess just a savings account and life insurance.

97
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,970
Life insurance? But aren't you still single?

98
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,970
What does a bachelor have to worry about.

99
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,970
I'm a bachelor now, but

100
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,980
I have someone I want to marry too.

101
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,980
Don't tell me...

102
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,990
Actually, I'm thinking about asking Aya-san to go out with me.

103
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,990
-I knew it.
-I frequented the restaurant

104
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,990
so I think she should know I'm sincere by now.

105
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,990
-I don't know about that.
-No, I'm serious.

106
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,000
Hey, get away, get away.

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
-You'll root for me, won't you?
-What do you mean root. We're not in middle school.

108
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You don't look too thrilled.

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
-Huh?
-Don't tell me

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,010
you're after Aya-san too.

111
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:44,010
-Of course not.
-Then

112
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,010
can you find out

113
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,020
how Aya-san feels about me?

114
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,020
Who, me?

115
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,020
"They heard their stepmother

116
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,020
talking to their father."

117
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,020
"'We must get rid of the children.'"

118
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:04,960
"'Take them deep into the forest so that they never find their way back.'"

119
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,970
"Hansel said to Gretel"

120
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:11,970
"'Don't cry, Gretel.
God will protect us.'"

121
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,970
Aya-chan, what's a stepmother?

122
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,980
The second mother who comes

123
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,980
after the real mother's gone?

124
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,990
Stepmothers are scary, huh?
Huh?

125
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,990
Yeah, Hansel and Gretel's stepmother's mean, isn't she?

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Aya-chan was reading us a book.

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
We have to write a book report.

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Aren't you supposed to read the book yourself for a book report?

129
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,010
But Aya-chan's a good reader.

130
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:51,010
I hope you guys are doing your other homework too.

131
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,010
We are. Look.

132
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,010
Where?

133
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,040
Kaoru, you're writing practically the same thing every day.

134
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,960
Yeah, because I'm generally doing the same thing every day.

135
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,960
How about you, Tomoki?

136
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,960
"Today we had stir fry."

137
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,960
"The core of the cabbage was tough."

138
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,970
"Thank you for the meal."

139
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,970
-Our dinner menu?
-Yes.

140
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,970
The day before was tarako spaghetti.

141
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,970
Jeez, don't you guys have anything else to write about?

142
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,980
What do you expect?
They haven't gone anywhere.

143
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,980
You ran out of things to draw for your picture diary, huh?

144
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,990
Now's about the only time they'd go on a trip with you.

145
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,990
If you go on thinking you can go anytime,

146
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,990
you'll end up not going at all.

147
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,990
A trip, huh?

148
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,990
Just a sec.

149
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Here it is.

150
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,010
Here, look.

151
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,010
Who are these people?

152
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:59,010
My junior on the baseball team in college and his family.

153
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,950
He went back to Yamanashi to work in the family's grape orchard.

154
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,950
-Yamanashi?
-Yeah.

155
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,950
Where is it?

156
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,950
Well...Pretend my head is Hokkaido.

157
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,960
Then if I do this, this part of my body is Honshu.

158
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,960
So the belly button is Tokyo.

159
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,960
Then if you go this way, this is...

160
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,960
you know, Mount Fuji. This is Mount Fuji, okay?

161
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,970
On the other side over on my right side.
Yamanashi's here.

162
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,970
-Clear as mud.
-Anyway, you'll see when you get there.

163
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,970
Okay, you wanna hop on over there for a visit? The grape orchard.

164
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,980
Really?
Yay~!

165
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:37,980
Grapes, grapes, yay, grapes.
Grapes, yay grapes.

166
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,990
A trip, huh? Sounds like fun.

167
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,990
Yeah. We get to swim in a river, not a pool.

168
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,990
Marumo told us

169
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:51,000
there're lots of real insects and bugs too.

170
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Stag beetles, and beetles.
Crayfish and snakes too.

171
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Come with us, Mommy.

172
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,940
Marumo said to invite you too.

173
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,940
Thanks. But I can't take time off work.

174
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,950
-You can't go?
-I want to, but maybe next time, okay?

175
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,950
Mommy will stay home.

176
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,950
You listen to Marumo-san, okay?

177
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,960
Okay.

178
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,960
We'll bring back a present for you.

179
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,960
Thanks. I'll be looking forward to it.

180
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,970
-Oyaji-san.
-Oh, hey.

181
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,970
I'm going to go pick up the kids while taking Mook for a walk.

182
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,970
-Okay.
-Can I go with you too?

183
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,980
I have some shopping to do.

184
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,980
-Wait a minute.
-Okay.

185
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,980
Looks like the kids and Ayumi-san are getting along.

186
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,990
Yes.

187
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,990
The kids look forward to seeing Ayumi-san too.

188
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:57,990
They must be, you know, getting more comfortable being a family.

189
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I wonder how long we can be together.

190
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,010
How much longer until Kaoru and Tomoki

191
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,010
say they want to live with Ayumi-san.

192
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,010
When that time comes, I'll of course

193
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,010
abide by their wishes.

194
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:24,020
But sometimes I get sad.

195
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,020
That one day we'll have to part.

196
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,030
It was hot today too, wasn't it?

197
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,030
Yes, it was.

198
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,040
Can you find out

199
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,040
how Aya-san feels about me?

200
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:53,050
-Um...you know...Aya-chan.
-Yes? What is it?

201
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:56,050
Is there someone you like?

202
00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:00,060
What?
Wait, what's this all of a sudden.

203
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:05,000
Aya-chan, you'd be annoyed if someone confessed to you suddenly, won't you?

204
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Well, I'd probably be more surprised than annoyed.

205
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:16,010
Look, there's Marumo. Aya-chan too.

206
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,010
Mommy, don't you think

207
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,010
-those two make a good pair?
-They certainly do.

208
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:26,020
I mean, you may have already noticed, but

209
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,020
-I think it's love.
-What?

210
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,020
What? Is that maybe...?

211
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,030
Yeah.

212
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,030
W-W-What? But...

213
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:39,030
I think it was love at first sight.

214
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,030
What the...

215
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:46,040
-And all this time ever since.
-All this time? What? All this time?

216
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,040
But

217
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,040
you had someone else you liked.
Makimura-san.

218
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,050
-Huh?
-Huh?

219
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,050
Huh?
No, no, no, no, no.

220
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,050
It's Mashima, not me.

221
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,070
What? Oh...

222
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:04,990
I...I knew that.
And I decline.

223
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,990
I'm not going out with anyone.

224
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:13,000
W-W-Wait a minute, Aya-chan. Aya-chan.

225
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Aya-cha's mad.
Did Marumo get rejected?

226
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,010
Seriously, he doesn't understand women at all.

227
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,010
Marumo.

228
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,010
Aya-chan.

229
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,010
Mook.

230
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,010
Hey.

231
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,020
Yummy.

232
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,030
-Here.
-Thank you.

233
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,030
-So Yamanashi, is it?
-Yes.

234
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,030
The family's growing grapes there.

235
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:50,040
Risa-chan, the wife, is my junior from college too.

236
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,040
She was the manager of the baseball team.

237
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,040
She was so cute she was everyone's idol.

238
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,040
So, as usual,
I bet

239
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,050
you were in love with that idol too, weren't you?

240
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,980
What? Well, a little.

241
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,980
You sure do like those idol types, don't you?

242
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,990
Thanks for your hard work.

243
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:15,990
So? Did you have something going with her too?

244
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,000
There was nothing. I'm the one who

245
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
-got them together.
-Got them together?

246
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
My junior, Daisuke, kept on nagging me to

247
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
be the go-between.

248
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,010
Intimidated by women in addition to being Mr. Nice Guy. You've always been that way, huh?

249
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,010
Well, yes.

250
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,010
Hey, Aya, aren't you acting a little hostile toward Mamoru today?

251
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,010
Not particularly.

252
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,020
Oh, then

253
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,020
we'll take care of Mook while you're gone, so go enjoy yourself.

254
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,020
What? Isn't Mook coming with us?

255
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,020
I want to take him.

256
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,030
Of course not.
Three of us are imposing on them as it is.

257
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:50,030
We can't have a dog tag along too.

258
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,030
Okay~.

259
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,980
We're here.

260
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,980
Takagi Senpai.

261
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,980
Hey, Daisuke.

262
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,990
It's been a long time.
You haven't changed at all.

263
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,990
You too. Here, some presents.

264
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,990
Wow, all this?
Thank you.

265
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,990
And this is Kaoru and Tomoki.

266
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,990
-Hello.
-Hello.

267
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,000
Hello. Nice to meet you.
Shall we go then?

268
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:15,040
Wow~ That's a big house.

269
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,040
That's Granny and Nana and Shota.

270
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,040
You can play with them later, okay?

271
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,040
-Hello.
-Hello.

272
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,040
Hello.

273
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:32,050
-I'm glad you came.
-Thanks for having us.

274
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,060
Come on in.

275
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,060
Risa, Takagi-san's here.

276
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,060
Risa. She must be working.

277
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,070
-Working?
-Yes, well...

278
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,070
She's getting some part-time work from the publisher she used to work for.

279
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,070
Huh? Wasn't she working in the orchard with you?

280
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,070
Not right now.

281
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,080
Takagi Senpai, it's been a while.

282
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,080
Risa-chan, long time no see.

283
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,080
It was a long way, wasn't it?

284
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,020
Sorry, we just kinda invited ourselves.

285
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,020
Bear with us for 2, 3 days.
Hey, say your greeting.

286
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,020
-Hello.
-Hello.

287
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:13,030
Hello. They're so cute.
They're twins, right?

288
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:18,030
Yeah. Kaoru and Tomoki. First graders. Sassy.

289
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,040
You can look forward to dinner.

290
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,040
-Risa has everything all prepared.
-Oh...

291
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,040
I'm sorry.
I don't have everything quite ready yet.

292
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,050
That's okay. Take it easy. Alright?

293
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,050
The grape orchard's behind the house.

294
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,050
Right here.

295
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:39,050
-This is awesome.
-Awesome.

296
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:43,060
Wow~.

297
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,060
Grapes all over.

298
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,060
First time I've seen this.

299
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,070
Grapes, grapes...looks yummy.

300
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,070
They're so excited.

301
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:01,080
All this belongs to your family, right?
That's impressive.

302
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:05,010
In reality, it's nothing to be praised about.

303
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:08,020
Our crop fluctuates from year to year, and

304
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,020
we don't necessarily sell everything we grow.

305
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,020
And here, I thought you guys were leading a leisurely life.

306
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,030
Far from it. We're just barely surviving.

307
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,030
I grew up watching my late father and mother

308
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,030
having a hard time making a living.

309
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:29,040
All I can think is I can't let it end during my watch.

310
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,040
That must be hard.

311
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,040
Until a little while ago, Risa was helping out too

312
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,040
and the two of us were busy working hard.

313
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:44,050
But she has a job now and truthfully, that job pays pretty well.

314
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:46,050
Grapes all over.
Grapes all over.

315
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:50,060
Grapes.
Grapes.

316
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,060
Hm? Grapes?

317
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:58,070
Are they samples? How nice.
Onee-chan, let's try some.

318
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,070
Okay.

319
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,070
What?

320
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:16,020
Stop.

321
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,020
Wah~.
Ahh~ Onee-chan.

322
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,020
Tomoki.

323
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:27,030
-Got 'em.
-Got 'em.

324
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,030
First time we succeeded, Onii-chan.

325
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:32,030
Yeah. We are, ready...

326
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:35,040
The Grape Warriors.
Purple Two.

327
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,040
-We shall meet again.
-Meet again.

328
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,050
Grape Warriors?

329
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,050
Onii-chan.

330
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:49,050
Damn it.
They got me.

331
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:52,050
What?
Onii-chan, are you alright?

332
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:56,060
Those guys used psychic powers to make me fall.

333
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,060
They're going to be hard to beat.

334
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,080
Are you alright?
That looks painful.

335
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,080
I have a band aid. I'll put it on for you.

336
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,010
Onii-chan, that's cute.

337
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,010
That should make it better right away.

338
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:20,010
Leave me alone.

339
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,010
Onii-chan.

340
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,020
The Grape Warriors are gone.

341
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,030
-Please, have a seat.
-Oh, thanks.

342
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,040
Is Risa-chan still working?

343
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,040
Yes, I'm sorry.

344
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,050
She says that it costs money to raise children. She asked me

345
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,050
if I can guarantee the kids' future with just the

346
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:55,050
income from the orchard.

347
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:58,050
I couldn't say anything.

348
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:04,990
Actually, Senpai, I need your advice.

349
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:10,000
-Hm? What is it?
-Risa wants to go to Tokyo...

350
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,010
Sorry.

351
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:23,010
-Hello?
-Takagi-san? What should I do?

352
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,010
What happened?

353
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:29,020
-I just got a call from the hospital.
-Hospital?

354
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:34,020
Dad collapsed when he was out and about.

355
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,020
What? Oyaji-san did?

356
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:39,030
An ambulance took him to the hospital.

357
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,030
Takagi-san, what do I do?

358
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:44,030
If something happens to Dad, I...

359
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:47,040
-Okay. Calm down now.
-Senpai?

360
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,040
Aya-chan, I'll head back right away.

361
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:57,040
-But...
-Calm down, okay? I'll see you in a bit.

362
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,960
-What happened?
-I'll have to go.

363
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,960
-What?
-Someone who's done a lot for me fell ill.

364
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,960
-Is he alright?
-I don't know.

365
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,970
-Are you going to tell the kids?
-No, I don't

366
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:16,970
want them to worry.

367
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:20,980
If it's okay with you,
the kids can stay with us.

368
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,980
Thanks. That'll help.

369
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,980
What?
You're going home?

370
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,980
Once I take care of business, I'll be right back.

371
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,990
You'll stay here, won't you?

372
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:35,990
No, we don't want to. We can't sleep over without Marumo.

373
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,990
-Why do you have to go?
-It's an important urgent business.

374
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:41,000
I have to hurry.

375
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'll explain everything later.

376
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
-It's gonna be lonely with just the 2 of us.
-What are you talking about?

377
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,010
-Remember the okite?
-We're family even if we're apart, right?

378
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:56,010
Even if we're apart, we're linked together

379
00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:00,010
-so you shouldn't be lonely, right?
-But...

380
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:04,950
Okay. If Marumo has an important business, we'll try our best.

381
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:08,960
-Okay, Tomoki?
-Okay.

382
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,960
Alright. Okite is never wrong. Let's do it.

383
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,970
-Okay.
-I'll be back before you know it, okay?

384
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,980
-Aya-chan.
-Takagi-san. I...I...

385
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,990
Oyaji-san.

386
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Oyaji-san.

387
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:02,940
-Don't touch me, fool.
-What? Oyaji-san?

388
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:08,950
Takagi-san, I'm sorry.
Apparently, I misunderstood.

389
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,950
-What?
-I told you Dad collapsed, but

390
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,960
looks like he just threw his back out.

391
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,960
Yeah, well...

392
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,960
I was out stocking up and when I lifted a box, I felt my back go out

393
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,970
and I fell to the ground just like that, but

394
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,970
I don't think collapsed is quite the right word.

395
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:31,970
I'm really sorry.

396
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:37,980
I tried to call you right away, but I couldn't get through.

397
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,980
You were looking forward to this trip too.

398
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,980
You're mad, aren't you?

399
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:54,990
I'm glad.
Then your life's not in danger or anything, right?

400
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I was just expecting the worst.

401
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,940
Takagi-san.

402
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:09,940
Did you leave the kids there?

403
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,940
Yes, but I didn't give them the details.

404
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,950
Anyway, I'm sorry.

405
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:20,960
No, no.
I'm glad it was nothing serious.

406
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,960
Thanks.

407
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,950
You just wait here until dinner, okay?

408
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:32,960
Yes.

409
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,960
Shota? Nana.

410
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:50,980
Onee-chan, what's that?

411
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Well, well, hello.

412
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
H-hello.

413
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:27,950
Onee-chan, Marumo will be back soon, won't he?

414
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,950
Yeah.

415
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,960
Oh, it's the Grape Warriors.

416
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,960
You guys can stay overnight by yourselves even though you're only first graders.

417
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,970
You have potential.  Alright.

418
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:50,970
-We'll let you join us.
-I agree.

419
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:54,970
-Accept this if you want to be our comrade.
-Comrade?

420
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,980
That's right.
But there's one condition.

421
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,980
You have to take the Oath of Grapes with us.

422
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,980
Oath of grapes?

423
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,980
Grapes for everyone.

424
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,980
Everyone for grapes.

425
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,990
We fight for our comrades.
Will you swear?

426
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,990
Will you swear?

427
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:14,990
-Yes.
-Thanks.

428
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:19,000
-Shota Purple.
-Nana Purple.

429
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
-Kaoru Purple.
-Tomoki Purple.

430
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,020
All Purple.
Grape Warriors, Purple Four.

431
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,940
（大輔）おっ。

432
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,940
Purple Two became Four, huh?
You look powerful.

433
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,950
Shota Purple, isn't there a Red?
-I want to be Red.

434
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:40,950
What are you talking about?
There aren't any red grapes.

435
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,950
I guess not.

436
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:47,960
Also, thanks for the band aid earlier, Kaoru Purple.

437
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,960
What's that about?

438
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,960
Hurry up and sit down. It's dinnertime.

439
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:05,980
-Delicious.
-Yum.

440
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,980
Kaoru-chan and Tomoki-kun, you're not lonely anymore, are you?

441
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,980
-No.
-That's a relief, huh?

442
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:16,990
Okay, I still have work to do.
Eat lots, okay?

443
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:19,990
Okay.

444
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,990
Isn't Oba-san eating with us?

445
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:25,990
Mom's busy.

446
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:32,940
Alright., let's go pick grapes tomorrow.

447
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,940
To be a great Grape Warrior, you need training.

448
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,940
Yay~.

449
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,940
Can't wait.

450
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,990
Senpai, is everything all right?

451
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:11,000
Well, I guess he just threw his back out. What a relief.

452
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Is that right?
That's good.

453
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Are the kids doing okay?

454
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,010
I just left them there suddenly so I imagine they're feeling lonely.

455
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:22,010
Actually, looks like they're having fun running around.

456
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:26,010
I knew it. Yeah, they'd be lone...

457
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:30,020
What? They're running around?
You're kidding.

458
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,020
At first they looked lonesome, but

459
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,020
now they're running around.
They're the Purple Four.

460
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,020
Purple Four.

461
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,030
Kids get acclimated real fast, don't they?

462
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:42,030
Yeah, but

463
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,970
they'll start getting lonely soon.

464
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:46,970
Watch, they'll cry in the middle of night.

465
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:49,970
Well, if that happens, I'll give you a call or whatever, so

466
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:53,970
-you can deal with them.
-Yeah, you do that.

467
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:57,980
Call me.
I'll keep in touch.

468
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,980
-Talk to you later.
-Okay.

469
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:16,000
Oh, Mook.

470
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
You finally noticed me, Marumo.

471
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
It's not that I'd forgotten about you.

472
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,010
But it's been kinda crazy.

473
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:29,010
I was alone all this time, you know.

474
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:32,010
It's lonesome being alone, huh?

475
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:36,020
I understand how you feel.

476
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,020
What's the matter?

477
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:43,020
I'm wondering how long I can be with Kaoru and Tomoki.

478
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,960
Takagi-san, excuse me.

479
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:53,970
Aya-chan. What's up?

480
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:56,970
I'm really sorry about what happened today.

481
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:59,970
I thought you might be hungry, so...

482
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:13,990
-It's good.
-I'm glad.

483
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:19,990
Are the kids doing alright?

484
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:23,000
I called a little while ago, and

485
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
apparently, they're having a great time playing with the kids over there.

486
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Oh, I'm glad to hear that.

487
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,010
Are you going back there tomorrow?

488
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:39,010
Oyaji-san should be coming home soon, right?

489
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:43,030
-I'll stick around to help until he does.
-Really? Are you sure?

490
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,950
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

491
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,960
Are you keeping the restaurant closed for a while?

492
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,960
No, I think he's going to want to re-open right away.

493
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,960
Yeah, he would.

494
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,970
He sprained his back once when I was a kid too.

495
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:00,970
He got carried away during Setsubun*.
(*Bean-throwing festival)

496
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:03,970
-During Setsubun?
-Yes.

497
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:08,980
Right after my mother passed away,
when I said I wanted to throw the beans,

498
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,980
Dad got all fired up and dressed up as the demon.

499
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,980
The hair, horns, everything looked real.

500
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,990
He looked really scary.

501
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,990
Then Dad messed up

502
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:24,990
his back as he was avoiding the beans, and hence, the ambulance.

503
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:28,000
The red demon in an ambulance?

504
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Yes.
He went on the ambulance still dressed like that.

505
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,010
But what I really wanted to do was throw the beans together.

506
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:45,950
After my mother passed away, the house was strangely quiet and lonely.

507
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:51,950
That's why I wanted to drive away the evil spirits with him.

508
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:55,960
But Dad got it wrong and became the demon.

509
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,960
What good does it do to drive away Dad.

510
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:07,960
But as soon as I yelled "Demons out," I felt much better.

511
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:14,970
Dad's thoughts came through to me loud and clear.

512
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,980
The best dad ever, huh?

513
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,980
Yes.

514
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:32,990
After you left, Dad kept on talking about you.

515
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,990
He must've been quite happy that you came back for him.

516
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I was happy too.

517
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:51,940
Really happy that you came back.

518
00:32:54,950 --> 00:33:00,950
Yeah, I was on my way home before I knew it.

519
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,970
I'm losing my patience now.

520
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:14,970
Alright.

521
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:20,970
-It's delicious.
-Really?

522
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:23,980
I'm glad.

523
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,930
Aya-chan, that's Tomoki's toy.

524
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:48,930
What?

525
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,950
Oh, um..I'm sorry.

526
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,950
Sorry.

527
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:06,950
Uh...um...I should get going.

528
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,960
Excuse me for intruding.

529
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,960
That's alright.

530
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:20,970
Ah~. And I tried to help you out too.

531
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:24,970
So that was you. What were you doing?

532
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:28,980
You should've seized the opportunity to score.

533
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,980
None of your damn business.

534
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,980
Onee-chan, it's so quiet.

535
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,990
Yeah.

536
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,930
Shota-kun, what was that?

537
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:03,940
Onee-chan, I wonder what Marumo's doing.

538
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,950
Yeah.

539
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:09,950
It's lonely not having Marumo around, huh?

540
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,950
Yeah.

541
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:16,960
Do you think Marumo will always let us sleep with him?

542
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,960
I'm sure he will.

543
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,960
'Cuz, you know, Marumo doesn't like to be alone either.

544
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,970
But what'll we do if Marumo gets married?

545
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:26,970
We might get a scary stepmother.

546
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:30,970
What? What should we do?

547
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:34,980
Oh, but

548
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,980
if he married Aya-chan, she'd be nice.

549
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,980
But Marumo got rejected, remember?

550
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,980
Oh, that's right.

551
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,920
If Marumo marries someone else and they have a baby,

552
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,930
maybe he won't want us anymore.

553
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:56,930
Will he get rid of us like Hansel and Gretel?

554
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:01,930
Will Marumo forget all about us?

555
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,480
Wow, they're huge.

556
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,480
Looks delicious.

557
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,480
-Mine are huge too.
-Mine too.

558
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,480
All of you, put your heart into it when you're harvesting.

559
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:23,490
The souls of our ancestors are in our grapes.

560
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:25,490
-Ancestors?
-Yeah, my

561
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:29,500
father and mother,
their father and mother, and

562
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:35,500
their father and mother.
They're all our ancestors.

563
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,500
There sure are a lot of ancestors, huh?

564
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,510
This grape orchard was preserved carefully by all of them.

565
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:45,510
People may die, but their spirits remain.

566
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:50,520
Our ancestors' spirit is what makes good grapes.

567
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,520
-It's a little hard to understand, huh?
-Yeah.

568
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,520
It means that's why our grapes are delicious.

569
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,520
-Right?
-Yeah.

570
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:11,470
You're right. It's delicious.

571
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:14,470
The ancestors are amazing.

572
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,480
Here you go.

573
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,480
-That's a lot of food.
-Eat lots, everyone.

574
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:30,490
She's gone again.

575
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:40,500
Why doesn't Shota-kun's mommy eat dinner with us?

576
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,500
She lives here. Why?

577
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,510
Mom's busy.

578
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:49,510
But she used to eat with us, huh? Onii-chan.

579
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:54,510
She worked in the orchard with us too.

580
00:37:54,510 --> 00:38:01,520
Mom never smiles anymore and she's always tired.

581
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,540
She fights with Dad a lot too.

582
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,460
She looked much happier before, huh?

583
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:13,470
-Yeah.
-Don't worry.

584
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:18,470
Even if she's busy, as long as your hearts are linked together.

585
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:21,470
-Hearts are linked together?
-Yes.

586
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:27,480
If the family's hearts are linked together,
she'll smile again.

587
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,480
She just doesn't remember that right now.

588
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,490
What does hearts linked together mean?

589
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:40,490
It means this here, and this here are linked together.

590
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:43,500
Here?

591
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,500
Kaoru-chan and Tomoki-kun,

592
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:49,500
are you okay even if Marumo-san's not here?

593
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,500
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

594
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,510
Because we're family even if we're apart.

595
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,510
What's that?

596
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,510
Marumo's okite.

597
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,510
Marumo's okite?

598
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,520
Yeah. It's a promise Marumo makes.

599
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:06,450
If we follow the okite, everyone can live in harmony.

600
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:11,460
Even if we're apart, we're still family, so we're not lonely at all.

601
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,460
Really?
You're not lonely at all?

602
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:18,460
Well, maybe just a little bit.

603
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:21,470
But Marumo's okite is never wrong.

604
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:24,470
If we try our best, Marumo praises us.

605
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:27,470
You're family even if you're apart?

606
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:31,480
Does that mean your hearts are linked together?

607
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,480
Hm.... I don't know.

608
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:39,490
-Heart is a difficult thing to understand, huh?

609
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,490
You'll understand one day.

610
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,490
-What?
-Hurry, hurry.

611
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:51,490
-What, what, what?
-Come, come.

612
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:58,490
Shota-kun, what's this place?

613
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:00,500
This is Grape Warriors' secret base.

614
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,500
Secret base?

615
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,500
What's this? It's awesome.

616
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:12,510
Wow, it's amazing.

617
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:18,510
Don't tell anyone.
It's a secret just for the Grape Warriors.

618
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:21,520
Roger.

619
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,520
What the Oath of Grape Warriors?

620
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,520
Grapes for everyone.

621
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,520
Everyone for grapes.

622
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,520
Yeah. Let's help out if anyone's in trouble.

623
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,480
We're gonna have a boat race.

624
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,480
Ready. Go.

625
00:40:57,490 --> 00:41:00,490
。

626
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:14,500
Nana-chan, what's the matter?

627
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,510
You wanna hear something good?

628
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,510
What?

629
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:23,510
A kappa* lives in that mountain.
(*legendary creatures living in ponds and rivers.)

630
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:27,520
What?
Kappa? That kappa?

631
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,520
They say kappa can grant your wish.

632
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,520
For real?

633
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,520
For real.
Granny said so.

634
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,520
Granny said she saw a kappa once.

635
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:42,530
-Granny.
-Granny.

636
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:48,470
Granny, you saw a kappa once, didn't you?

637
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:52,480
-I sure did.
-So she did.

638
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,480
There's some at Kappabuchi too, right?

639
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:01,480
That was a long time ago.
When Granny was a child.

640
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,490
Can we see them too?

641
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:09,490
I'm not sure.
There used to be many long time ago,

642
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:15,500
But now he's all alone so I imagine he's lonely and bored.

643
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,500
-I hope you get to see it.
-Granny,

644
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,500
Does kappa really grant your wish?

645
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,510
Sh~ That's a secret.

646
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:29,510
But it's true.
Just one wish that's important to you.

647
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:31,510
So it's true.

648
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:34,520
Don't go to Kappabuchi.

649
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:37,520
-Dad.
-It's dangerous there. Stay away.

650
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,520
Granny, don't tell them stuff like that.

651
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,530
That place is off limits right now.

652
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:45,530
Don't know what she's gonna tell them.

653
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:27,470
-That was fun, wasn't it?
-Can't you even make time

654
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:32,480
to eat?
Come on, Risa. Are you still busy?

655
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,480
The kids are leaving tomorrow.

656
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,480
-At least have dinner with them...
-Sorry.

657
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,490
I don't think I can.
Deadline's coming up.

658
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:44,490
Do you still want to take them back to Tokyo?

659
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:46,490
I've already told you over and over.

660
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:49,500
Of course that would be much better for their future.

661
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,500
I think they would be better off staying here.

662
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:58,510
As things are, can you guarantee their future?

663
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,510
Do you think you can enhance their well-being?

664
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:02,510
That...

665
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:07,510
I'll find a way.

666
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,520
The orchard business isn't going well,

667
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,520
and you know yourself that it's going to be difficult.

668
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:29,470
Onii-chan. Mom and Dad

669
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:33,470
were fighting again.

670
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:38,480
Shota-kun, Nana-chan.
I think it'll be okay even if they fight.

671
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,480
It's not okay.

672
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,480
But you're family whether you like it or not.

673
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,490
That's Marumo's okite.

674
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:47,490
Family whether you like it or not?

675
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:50,490
Yeah. Even if you fight, it's okay because you're still family.

676
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:52,490
That's what Marumo said.

677
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:54,500
But still, I don't want them to fight.

678
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:58,500
We like it better when they're friends, right? Onii-chan.

679
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,500
Yeah.

680
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,500
What can we do?

681
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:10,510
Oh, how about the kappa?
Let's ask the kappa.

682
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:12,510
Yeah, let's do that.

683
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:16,520
Kappa is out.
Dad'll get mad.

684
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,520
But doesn't kappa grant wishes?

685
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,520
Yeah. I want to ask kappa too.

686
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,540
Let's go see the kappa, Onii-chan.

687
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:26,460
But Dad told us not to go there cuz it's dangerous.

688
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,460
So you don't care if your daddy and mommy fights all the time?

689
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:31,470
Let's ask the kappa to help them make up.

690
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:33,470
Let's do it, Onii-chan.

691
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:37,470
Yeah, okay.

692
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,480
Alright. The Grape Warriors will embark on our secret mission.

693
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,480
Everyone, keep your guard up.

694
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,480
Roger.

695
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:16,510
-Okay, let's go.
-Roger.

696
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:20,510
Sh~ Sh~

697
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,460
-Mission accomplished.

698
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:36,460
Kappa, Kappa, Kappa-san.
Please come out, Kappa-san.

699
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:40,470
We want to see the Kappa.
Purple Four.

700
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:43,470
Come out, come out, Kappa-san.

701
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:50,480
Kappa, Kappa, Kappa-san.
We have a wish, Kappa-san.

702
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,480
We want to see the Kappa.
Purple Four.

703
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,490
Come out, come out, Kappa-san.

704
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:02,490
We want to see the Kappa.
Purple Four.

705
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:04,490
This is it.

706
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:06,490
It looks a place we might find kappa.

707
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,510
If we leave them here,

708
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:21,510
he'll come out lured by the smell of cucumber.

709
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:34,450
Where's kappa's house?

710
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:37,460
Maybe in the swamp?

711
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:42,460
But he might be in the bushes looking for food.

712
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:46,470
He could come out from anywhere, so look carefully.

713
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:50,470
Got it.

714
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:55,470
Ka-ka-ka...k-k-k-kappa?

715
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:02,480
D-Dad.

716
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:13,490
Hey, Shota, Nana. I know you're here.

717
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:17,500
Come on out.
If you come out now, I'll let it slide.

718
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:22,500
3, 2, 1.

719
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,440
I'm sorry.

720
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,440
You idiot!

721
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,450
You said you wouldn't get mad.

722
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:35,450
Of course I'll get mad.

723
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:38,450
There were stories about kappa since Dad was a kid too.

724
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:40,450
But someone who came to look for kappa

725
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:43,460
fell into the pool and died.

726
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:46,460
That's why this place is off limits.

727
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,460
Don't come anymore. Got that?

728
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:51,470
Yes.

729
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,470
What did you guys come to ask for?

730
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:58,470
It's a secret.

731
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:03,480
I see.

732
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:09,480
Kaoru-chan, Tomok-kun. Takagi-san will be here this afternoon to pick you up.

733
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,480
-Let's head home now.
-Okay.

734
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:24,430
Shota-kun, our secret mission ended in failure, huh?

735
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:26,430
Yeah.

736
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:29,440
Sorry we couldn't help.

737
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:48,450
They're not here yet.

738
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:56,460
I know for sure that they're feeling lonesome.

739
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:00,470
Marumo.

740
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:03,470
Marumo.
Marumo.

741
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:07,470
-We missed you.
-We were so lonely.

742
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:11,480
Sorry, guys. Sorry.

743
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:14,480
Sorry. Sorry.

744
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,480
That's how it's gonna be.
-Yup, that's how it'll be.

745
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,490
Marumo.

746
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:21,490
-Kaoru, Tomoki.
-Marumo.

747
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:24,490
Marumo.

748
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:31,430
Marumo, I don't want to go home yet.

749
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:33,430
-Huh?
-Me too.

750
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:35,440
-What?
-We're going to stay here

751
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,440
a little longer so can you come back next week?

752
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,440
Didn't you guys miss me?

753
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,440
Look, Marumo's here.

754
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,450
Takagi Senpai.

755
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:47,450
Thanks for coming all the way.

756
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:49,450
Sorry I ended up causing you trouble.

757
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:52,450
Not at all. My kids had fun too.

758
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:56,460
-I don't wanna go home yet.
-Me too.

759
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,460
You can come anytime.
We'll be waiting.

760
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:01,460
Thanks a lot.
We'll come again next year.

761
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,460
See you then.

762
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:07,470
We'll come again.

763
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:09,470
-We'll come again.
-Bye bye.

764
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:21,480
Hey, you guys. Were you serious when you said you didn't want to go home?

765
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,500
Yeah.
Because our

766
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,420
-secret mission failed.
-Secret mission?

767
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:30,420
-Goya Chanpuru*. -Sounds good.
(*Okinawan stir fry with bitter melon)

768
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:36,430
Oyaji-san, are you alright?

769
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:38,430
Is your back better?

770
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:40,430
Oh. I told them on the train coming back

771
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,440
-and they've been worried ever since.
-Oh, is that right?

772
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:45,440
Thanks. I'm much better now.
See?

773
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,440
-I'm glad.
-I'm glad.

774
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,440
Oh, that's right.

775
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:56,450
-Here, Oyaji-san. Present for you.
-Thanks.

776
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:59,450
Oh? A hand towel? And this. Like this?

777
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:02,450
Thanks. That's feels good.

778
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:07,460
-Here, this is for you, Aya-chan.
-Thanks.

779
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:10,460
-We got one for you too, Marumo.
-For me too? Thanks.

780
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:15,470
Oh, kappa? Cute.

781
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:18,470
That area's known for its kappa folklore, right?

782
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:21,480
-Yeah.
-This thing

783
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,440
on its back here. What is it?

784
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,310
-Oh, yeah.
-Put it together, and ka-ching.

785
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,320
A heart?

786
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:32,320
Hey, what's this? This is ridiculous.

787
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,320
Dummy. What the.... Dummy

788
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,320
Love plus love equals love love.

789
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:40,330
Love love marriage.
Love love marriage.

790
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:42,330
-Love love marriage...
-Hey, stop it.

791
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:54,460
Onee-chan, it was fun (zura), huh?
(imitating Granny's Yamanashi dialect w/"zura")

792
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:56,470
It was (zura).

793
00:52:56,470 --> 00:53:00,470
I wonder how Shota-kun and Nana-chan's doing.

794
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:05,480
I wanted to be a Grape Warrior too (zura).

795
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:09,480
Let's go together next time, okay?

796
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:12,480
-Tadaima.
-Okaerinasai-zura.

797
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,490
What's with this "zura."

798
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:17,490
-What's this?
-It's a delivery~.

799
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:24,490
Oh, it's from Daisuke.
What can it be?

800
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:26,500
Ta-da.
Grapes.

801
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:29,500
-Looks good.
-Yeah.

802
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,510
Good.

803
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:37,510
Sweet.

804
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:41,510
-Hello.
-Thanks, we got the grapes.

805
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:44,530
Senpai, you never did get to eat the grapes, right?

806
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:46,450
Just let me know and I can send them any time.

807
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:50,450
Thanks. How's everyone?

808
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:52,450
How's Shota-kun and Nana-chan?

809
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:56,460
Daisuke?

810
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:59,460
The kids left home.

811
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:02,470
Risa took them to her parents' home in Tokyo.

812
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:04,470
-What?
-Actually,

813
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:07,470
we'd been arguing about the kids for a while now.

814
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:09,470
She insisted that it's better for the kids' future

815
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:12,480
to live in Tokyo.

816
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,480
Did you talk it over with Risa-chan?

817
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:19,480
Yes. I can't abandon the orchard,

818
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,490
plus I have Granny too, so

819
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:25,490
I tried to stop her, but...

820
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:31,490
Senpai, I wanted to raise my children here

821
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:33,490
at least while they were still kids.

822
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:44,470
There may be some inconvenience, but I wanted them to grow up

823
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:47,470
appreciating the things that can only be found here.

824
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:55,350
But I don't know what to do now.

825
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:06,360
I heard from Daisuke that you were in Tokyo.

826
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,370
Shota-kun and Nana-chan. Are they well?

827
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:15,370
They haven't quite adjusted to the lifestyle here yet.

828
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:18,380
Daisuke was worried.

829
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:22,380
About the kids and about you too, Risa-chan.

830
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:27,380
I want to take full responsibility

831
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:29,390
for the children's future too.

832
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:31,390
We have to do our best here.

833
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:37,390
What about the children? Have you thought about their feelings?

834
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,400
Takagi-san,

835
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,440
what are you doing about Kaoru-chan and Tomoki-kun's future?

836
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,440
What?

837
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,440
How are you planning to raise them?

838
00:55:57,450 --> 00:56:00,450
If you're going to part with them someday,

839
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:03,450
that might be fine, but

840
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:07,460
I'm their mother for the rest of my life.

841
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:19,460
I agree that what you're saying is the right thing, as a parent.

842
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:28,470
Honestly, I don't know what to do about Kaoru and Tomoki's future.

843
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:36,490
I have my hands full just living day to day with them,

844
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:38,490
let alone the future.

845
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:47,430
Oh, that's right. If you want,

846
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:51,430
why don't you have Shota-kun and Nana-chan come over to play?

847
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:53,440
Kaoru and Tomoki's been wanting to see them too.

848
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:58,440
During the day when you're at work. How's that sound?

849
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,450
Thank you.

850
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:16,460
Come in.

851
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:21,460
-Shota Purple.
-Nana Purple. What happened?

852
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:26,470
They're my friend's kids from Yamanashi.
Shota-kun and Nana-chan.

853
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:28,470
-Hello.
-Hello.

854
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:30,470
-Well, hello.
-Hello.

855
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,480
What?
You're going to be in Tokyo from now on?

856
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:46,420
We're going to be living in Tokyo, apart from Dad.

857
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:51,430
Sorry. It's because our secret mission failed.

858
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:55,430
Because we didn't get to see the kappa.

859
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:58,430
I wonder how Dad and Granny are doing.

860
00:57:58,430 --> 00:58:03,440
I wish Dad and Mom would make up.

861
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,440
Our family became separated.

862
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:09,450
That's not true. Families don't get separated.

863
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:12,450
Because even when you're apart, you're family.

864
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:15,450
Let's ask Marumo.
Marumo's amazing.

865
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:18,450
He can make everyone get along again.

866
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:26,460
Marumo.

867
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:29,470
Why is Shota-kun and Nana-chan's family separated?

868
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:34,470
Isn't it strange to live separately when both mommy and daddy are alive?

869
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:36,470
How can they get back together again?

870
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:39,480
Huh, Marumo.

871
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:42,480
It's not that simple.

872
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,420
Grown-ups have grown-up circumstances.

873
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:47,420
There are things outsiders should stay out of.

874
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:51,420
Marumo? It's impossible even for you, Marumo?

875
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:53,420
Not everything goes the way you want.

876
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:59,430
Just because you're family doesn't mean you have to be together.

877
00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:01,430
There are different circumstances.

878
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:04,430
But it doesn't say that in the okite notebook.

879
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:06,440
That's not what the okite says.

880
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,440
There are times it can't be helped.

881
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:21,450
Shota-kun, Nana-chan.

882
00:59:21,450 --> 00:59:26,460
You mom and dad loves you both very much.

883
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:31,460
That's why they decided to live separately now for your future.

884
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:35,470
But even then, I want us to be together.

885
00:59:35,470 --> 00:59:38,470
Me too.

886
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:43,470
Marumo's okite isn't amazing at all.

887
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:56,480
Oh, Aya.

888
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,480
I'm going to Kappabashi to take a look at some supplies.

889
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,480
-Okay.
-What~!

890
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,480
Kappa?!

891
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:05,490
-Yeah, Kappa.
T-here's this place called Kappabashi

892
01:00:05,490 --> 01:00:08,490
where they sell a lot of dishes and knives and stuff like that.

893
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:10,490
Do they have kappa at Kappabashi too?

894
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:13,490
Huh? Well...

895
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:15,500
I don't know about that.

896
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:18,500
But kappa folklores are everywhere, so

897
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,500
maybe they used to be in Tokyo too, huh?

898
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,500
-Dad.
-Awesome.

899
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:26,510
They might be in Tokyo too.
But where in Tokyo?

900
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:30,510
We could find them if we can hear them cry.
Do kappas cry?

901
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:34,510
I'm not sure if they do.

902
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:37,520
Ke~en, ke-en.

903
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:45,530
That's how kappa cries - ke-en, ke-en.

904
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:48,530
What? Is that true, Onee-san?

905
01:00:48,530 --> 01:00:51,530
-Is that true?
-Yes, it's true.

906
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:56,470
I heard that from the person I'm dating.

907
01:00:58,470 --> 01:01:00,470
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

908
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:03,480
Thank you.

909
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:05,480
Who's that?

910
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:08,480
-I don't know.
-Kappa does exist.

911
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:12,480
Yay, yay, yay.

912
01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:16,490
Where could the kappa be?

913
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:18,490
This is Kappabashi, so

914
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:22,500
if kappa does exist, maybe around here?

915
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:26,500
Shota Purple, I think it's this river here.

916
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,500
-Here?
-Yeah.

917
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:33,510
Mook?
Do you want to join in too?

918
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:37,510
-Shota Purple, is it okay?
-Please let him join.

919
01:01:37,510 --> 01:01:40,510
I'll make a special exception then.

920
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:43,520
Hooray~

921
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,520
We are, ready...

922
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:51,520
The Grape Warriors.
The Purple Four.

923
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:54,460
Plus

924
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:57,460
One.
(instead of Woof! Japanese dogs bark Wan!)

925
01:01:59,470 --> 01:02:01,470
-Here.
-Okay.

926
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:06,470
-Thank you for waiting.
-Thank you for waiting.

927
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:12,470
-Thank you for waiting.
-Thank you for waiting.

928
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:20,490
-What's next?
-What shall we take?

929
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:23,490
Well. Anyway, you were a big help.

930
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:26,490
Yeah, real big help. Thanks.

931
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:29,500
Ready~.
Oyaji-san.

932
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:32,500
-What?
-We'd like to get paid

933
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:35,500
-for our work.
-Oh, so that's what this was about.

934
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,500
Aya, give them 100 yen each.

935
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:40,510
-Alright.
-We don't want money zura.

936
01:02:40,510 --> 01:02:42,510
That's right zura.

937
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:44,510
That's right zura?

938
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:48,510
-Thank you for the business.
-Thank you for the business.

939
01:02:57,460 --> 01:02:59,460
Why cucumbers?

940
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:01,460
I'm not sure.

941
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,480
What's that?

942
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:30,490
What's a cucumber doing here?

943
01:03:30,490 --> 01:03:35,490
It's coming. Kappa's coming.

944
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:44,500
What's this?

945
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:46,510
It's coming.
Here it comes.

946
01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:49,510
It's getting closer.

947
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:55,450
-What's this?
-Now.

948
01:03:55,450 --> 01:03:58,450
Wha-wha-what?

949
01:03:58,450 --> 01:04:01,450
-What, what is this?
-Got the kappa.

950
01:04:01,450 --> 01:04:04,460
Got it.

951
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:08,460
-Huh? Officer?
-What is this?

952
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:10,460
-He's not a kappa.
-Officer,

953
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:14,470
where's the kappa?
-Kappa?

954
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:17,470
-And give us back the cucumbers.
-Huh?

955
01:04:17,470 --> 01:04:20,470
I'm really sorry.
I'll give them a good talking to.

956
01:04:20,470 --> 01:04:22,480
That area is very dangerous for children.

957
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,480
Please be careful.

958
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,480
I'm sorry. Good bye.

959
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:34,490
Hey you guys. Why did you do such thing?

960
01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:36,490
You too, Mook.

961
01:04:36,490 --> 01:04:40,490
-Because we wanted to see the kappa.
-Kappa?

962
01:04:40,490 --> 01:04:43,500
Kappa can grant us our wish, you know.

963
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:47,500
So we wanted to see the kappa and ask him to make Shota-kun and

964
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:50,500
Nana-chan's mommy and daddy to make up.

965
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,440
It's called "Operation Let's Catch the Kappa."

966
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:57,440
Kappa is lonely all by himself, right?

967
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,450
So he'll be happy if we give him our treasure.

968
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:02,450
He'll grant us our wish too.

969
01:05:02,450 --> 01:05:05,450
Treasure is something that's important to you, isn't it?

970
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:08,450
They're important, but our wish is more important.

971
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:14,460
Look. There's no such thing as kappa.

972
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:16,460
-There is.
-There is.

973
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:19,460
Looking for kappa is too dangerous. Don't do it anymore.

974
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:29,480
You two are the top priority for your mom and dad.

975
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:32,480
They made the decision for your sake.

976
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:35,480
Grownups have different circumstances.

977
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:38,480
It can't be helped.

978
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:52,470
Marumo said there's no such thing as kappa, didn't he?

979
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:54,330
Yeah.

980
01:05:54,330 --> 01:05:56,340
About Shota-kun and Nana-chan too,

981
01:05:56,340 --> 01:06:00,340
he said it can't be helped because grownups have circumstances.

982
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:08,350
Marumo and us, if we ever have to live separately,

983
01:06:08,350 --> 01:06:12,350
will Marumo say it can't be helped?

984
01:06:12,350 --> 01:06:17,360
I don't want that to happen.
Why did he say that?

985
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:21,360
That wasn't like Marumo.

986
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:23,360
Yeah.

987
01:06:30,370 --> 01:06:34,370
Those guys were seriously looking for kappa.

988
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:38,380
Kappa. Ah, that's what the cucumbers were for.

989
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:41,380
It's your fault, Dad, for opening your mouth.

990
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:46,390
They said they're gonna find the kappa and ask him to grant their wish.

991
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:49,390
To make Shota-kun and Nana-chan's parents make up.

992
01:06:51,390 --> 01:06:56,430
Not only cucumbers, but they were even ready to give up their treasures.

993
01:06:56,430 --> 01:06:58,430
They were going to give them to the kappa.

994
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:03,440
That means Kaoru and Tomoki are growing up.

995
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,440
They're willing to go that far for their friends.

996
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:08,440
Yes.

997
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:12,440
I understand how they feel, but

998
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:15,450
it can't be helped.

999
01:07:15,450 --> 01:07:18,450
Both Daisuke and Risa-chan

1000
01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:22,450
put a lot of thought into the children's future.

1001
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:30,460
I don't know how much thought I'm putting into Kaoru and Tomoki's future.

1002
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:39,470
About the kappa too. I wish I could grant their wish, but

1003
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:44,470
I'm not sure it's something I should stick my nose into.

1004
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,480
What do you think I should do?

1005
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,480
I even told them there's no such thing as kappa.

1006
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:01,430
Children doesn't give a hoot about grown ups' logic.

1007
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:03,430
Whether it's kappa, or aliens, or

1008
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:07,430
even that demon you throw the beans at.

1009
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:12,440
Isn't it important to just let them believe that those things exist?

1010
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:14,440
Believing that they exist,

1011
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:18,440
chasing after them and confronting them,

1012
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:22,440
that's what gives the children strength, don't you think?

1013
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:27,450
What I mean is,

1014
01:08:27,450 --> 01:08:32,450
shouldn't you cherish their desire to believe too?

1015
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:48,490
Takagi-san, did you find out how Aya-san feels?

1016
01:08:48,490 --> 01:08:50,500
Huh? Yeah, well, yeah.

1017
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:53,500
Are you listening to me? Ta...

1018
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:57,500
What are you drawing?

1019
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:02,510
-Have you ever seen a kappa?
-Kappa? What are you talking about?

1020
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:04,510
Of course I've never seen one.

1021
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:06,510
You wouldn't, right?

1022
01:09:06,510 --> 01:09:08,510
Kappa, huh?

1023
01:09:08,510 --> 01:09:11,520
What? Could it be that you've seen one, Samejima-san?

1024
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:13,520
Of course not, they don't exist.

1025
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:16,520
-Of course.
-As I thought.

1026
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:19,530
I thought maybe Samejima-san would say "They do exist," but

1027
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:22,530
-they don't exist, do they?
-Why are you looking for kappa?

1028
01:09:22,530 --> 01:09:25,530
Kaoru and Tomoki,

1029
01:09:25,530 --> 01:09:28,530
they're looking for a kappa for their friends.

1030
01:09:28,530 --> 01:09:31,540
They got it in their head that if they can find a kappa

1031
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:34,540
and make a wish, their friends' family can be happy.

1032
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:38,560
-Ah...
-As if it existed.

1033
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:42,480
But I kinda want to let them see it.

1034
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,480
Even if their wish doesn't come true,

1035
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:47,490
I want them to think that their wish got through.

1036
01:09:47,490 --> 01:09:53,490
I want them to think that it's not pointless to wish for something.

1037
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:56,500
Anyway, it's nothing. Please forget it.

1038
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,500
I see.

1039
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:05,500
Kappa, huh? Maybe it does exist.

1040
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:07,510
What are you looking at?

1041
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:09,510
Yeah, come to think of it...

1042
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:11,510
Huh?

1043
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:16,520
Wait, what are you looking at? What?

1044
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:18,520
What do you do to be a kappa?

1045
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:22,520
Let's see...This?

1046
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:25,520
-Takagi-san.
-Oh, Kana-san.

1047
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:28,530
You're really into this, aren't you?
I heard about it from the people in your office.

1048
01:10:28,530 --> 01:10:30,530
Well, yes.

1049
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:33,530
I thought maybe you could use this.

1050
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:35,530
What is this?

1051
01:10:35,530 --> 01:10:37,540
It was used at the PR Department's year-end party last year,

1052
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:40,470
but it's just been sitting in our storage room since.

1053
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:42,470
You can use it if you want.

1054
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:45,480
-This...
-Tell me all about it later, okay?

1055
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:49,480
-Yes.
-It's perfect.

1056
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:52,480
Really?
Thank you very much.

1057
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:04,500
Hey, guys.

1058
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:10,500
About the kappa.
Actually, kappa does exist.

1059
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:13,510
What?
Really?

1060
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:16,510
Yeah. I found a great kappa.

1061
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:18,510
Awesome.

1062
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:20,510
This, this. This is the map.

1063
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:23,520
This Sunday, at this time.

1064
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,520
Go see him with Shota-kun and Nana-chan.

1065
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:29,520
Alright!

1066
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:33,530
There is a kappa.
There is a kappa.

1067
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:36,530
Leave it to Marumo.

1068
01:11:36,530 --> 01:11:40,470
Nothing's impossible for Marumo.

1069
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:42,470
But,

1070
01:11:42,470 --> 01:11:44,470
it might be better if you don't get too close to him.

1071
01:11:44,470 --> 01:11:46,470
-How come?
-I mean

1072
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:50,480
kappa is a supernatural monster, you know.
Who knows if you'll be safe around him, right?

1073
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,480
-Yeah.
-Yeah, so

1074
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,480
you really shouldn't stare at him.

1075
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,480
Just take a quick peek from afar, okay?

1076
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,480
-Got it.
-Got it.

1077
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:04,490
Yay, yay. Kappa did exist. Yay, yay.

1078
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:09,490
That's a cute treasure box.

1079
01:12:09,490 --> 01:12:11,500
Yeah.

1080
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:14,500
A slice of watermelon.

1081
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:17,500
-Shota-kun, what are you drawing?
-I'm drawing stars right now.

1082
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:21,510
-This is mine.
-This is Kaoru's.

1083
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:23,510
-This is Nana's.
-Do you think Kappa-san will like them?

1084
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:25,510
He'll grant us our wish, won't he?

1085
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:28,510
Yeah.

1086
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:36,520
Shota, Nana. Lunch is ready.

1087
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:42,460
Shota?

1088
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:01,490
Kappa, Kappa, Kappa-san.

1089
01:13:01,490 --> 01:13:04,490
Please come out, Kappa-san.

1090
01:13:04,490 --> 01:13:07,490
We want to see the Kappa.
Purple Four.

1091
01:13:07,490 --> 01:13:11,500
Come out, come out, Kappa-san.

1092
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:16,500
Okay, let's say the Oath of Grape Warriors. Ready.

1093
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:20,500
Grapes for everyone.
Everyone for grapes.

1094
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:24,510
We'll reach our destination soon but don't get scared.

1095
01:13:24,510 --> 01:13:26,510
Roger.

1096
01:13:26,510 --> 01:13:30,510
Shota Purple, I think it's over there.

1097
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:33,520
Alright, let's go.

1098
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:39,520
-Ready.
-Kappa, Kappa, Kappa-san.

1099
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:42,530
Kana-san said "It's perfect," but

1100
01:13:42,530 --> 01:13:44,530
I'm not so sure.

1101
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:47,530
Kappa, Kappa, Kappa-san.

1102
01:13:47,530 --> 01:13:50,530
Please come out, Kappa-san.

1103
01:13:50,530 --> 01:13:54,540
Aren't they here too early?

1104
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:58,480
Come out, come out, Kappa-san.

1105
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:02,480
-Where is he?
-Where is he?

1106
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:12,490
There.
Is that Kappa-san?

1107
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:19,490
Excuse me.
Are you Ka-Ka-Kappa-san?

1108
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:31,500
Are you really, really Ka-Kappa-san?

1109
01:14:36,510 --> 01:14:38,520
He's real!

1110
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:42,520
Hooray~ Yay, yay.

1111
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:47,520
Kappa-san, we want you to grant us a wish.

1112
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:50,530
We brought you our treasures.

1113
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:53,530
Will you hear our wish?

1114
01:14:55,530 --> 01:15:00,530
Yay~ Alright.

1115
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:14,480
Onii-chan, it's the kappa.

1116
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:17,490
Yeah.

1117
01:15:17,490 --> 01:15:23,490
Kappa-san, we have a wish.

1118
01:15:23,490 --> 01:15:27,500
Please grant us our wish.

1119
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:37,510
Right now, my family's separated.

1120
01:15:37,510 --> 01:15:41,510
Even though we all got along well before.

1121
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:46,510
But I still want the family to live together.

1122
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:51,520
-Please.
-Kappa-san, please.

1123
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,520
Please.

1124
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:59,460
Dad's out in the countryside with just Granny.

1125
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:02,470
He must be lonesome.

1126
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:06,470
Mom doesn't smile anymore lately.

1127
01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:10,470
She's busy so it can't be helped.

1128
01:16:10,470 --> 01:16:13,480
I love Dad, and

1129
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:17,480
I love when Mom smiles, so

1130
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:23,480
I want us to be together like before.

1131
01:16:26,490 --> 01:16:31,490
Would that be impossible? Would it too hard?

1132
01:16:31,490 --> 01:16:39,500
If that's impossible, if it's impossible no matter what,

1133
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:47,510
we'll try to endure being apart, but then

1134
01:16:47,510 --> 01:16:50,510
please make it so that

1135
01:16:50,510 --> 01:16:54,510
Dad keeps on loving Mom.

1136
01:16:57,540 --> 01:17:00,460
Even if the family can't live together,

1137
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:04,460
even if we're apart, we'll endure it,

1138
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:07,460
so please make it so that

1139
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:11,470
Mom doesn't stop loving Dad.

1140
01:17:11,470 --> 01:17:13,470
Please.

1141
01:17:17,470 --> 01:17:20,470
I'll endure it too, so please.

1142
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:27,480
Shota. Nana.

1143
01:17:29,490 --> 01:17:33,490
Kappa-san, do you know that even if we're apart, we're family?

1144
01:17:33,490 --> 01:17:36,490
It's Marumo's okite.

1145
01:17:36,490 --> 01:17:40,500
So please let Shota-kun's family get along again

1146
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:43,500
so that they can be family even if they're apart.

1147
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:46,500
-Please.
-Please.

1148
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:51,510
He said okay.

1149
01:17:59,350 --> 01:18:08,360
Kappa-san. Can we throw in one more bonus wish?

1150
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:12,360
Please grant us a bonus wish.

1151
01:18:15,370 --> 01:18:19,370
Kappa-san, do you know Marumo?

1152
01:18:22,370 --> 01:18:25,380
Marumo gets mad easily, gets lonely easily, cries easily,

1153
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:28,380
but he's kind.

1154
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:30,380
No matter how busy he is,

1155
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:33,380
he always does his best for Kaoru and Tomoki.

1156
01:18:35,390 --> 01:18:39,390
That's why I love Marumo the most in the whole world.

1157
01:18:39,390 --> 01:18:43,390
Me too. I love him the most in the whole world.

1158
01:18:43,390 --> 01:18:49,400
So I want to stay with him in the future too.

1159
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:56,410
But we aren't real father and children.

1160
01:18:56,410 --> 01:19:03,450
So maybe one day we might be separated.

1161
01:19:03,450 --> 01:19:08,450
If Marumo gets married, we might get abandoned.

1162
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:13,460
So even if Marumo gets married, even if we get separated,

1163
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:15,460
please make it so that he'll

1164
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:19,460
keep on loving Kaoru and Tomoki forever and ever.

1165
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:22,470
Even if we're separated because of grown ups' circumstances,

1166
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:24,470
please make it so that

1167
01:19:24,470 --> 01:19:27,470
Marumo would keep on loving us forever and ever.

1168
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:30,470
-Please.
-Please.

1169
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:40,480
Of course, I'll love you forever. Seriously.

1170
01:19:45,490 --> 01:19:49,490
He said okay.
Onee-chan, he said he'll grant us our wish.

1171
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:51,490
We did it, Tomoki.

1172
01:19:51,490 --> 01:19:53,500
-Onii-chan, we did it.
-We did it.

1173
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:02,440
Alright, line up.

1174
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:06,440
Thank you, Kappa-san.

1175
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:08,440
We're... ready...

1176
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:12,440
the Grape Warriors.
Purple Four.

1177
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:24,460
Alright, let's go.

1178
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:28,460
Kappa, Kappa, Kappa-san.

1179
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:31,470
Thank you, thank you, Kappa-san.

1180
01:20:31,470 --> 01:20:33,470
So that's the Purple Four.

1181
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:47,480
Huh? Where are the treasures?

1182
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:50,490
I'm sure they left them around here.

1183
01:20:56,490 --> 01:21:02,430
What~! Ka-Ka-Kappa!

1184
01:21:02,430 --> 01:21:08,430
-Takagi-san?
-Oh, Risa-chan.

1185
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,440
I found a kappa~.

1186
01:21:24,450 --> 01:21:31,460
I came back to Tokyo believing that it was for the children's sake,

1187
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:36,460
but now that I know how they feel, I'm not sure of anything anymore.

1188
01:21:39,470 --> 01:21:41,470
What Risa-chan's saying

1189
01:21:41,470 --> 01:21:43,470
about it being for the children's sake.

1190
01:21:43,470 --> 01:21:46,480
I can understand it too.

1191
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:51,480
When I think about the children's future, I get anxious too.

1192
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:54,480
-Yeah.
-But in our case,

1193
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:59,420
I don't know how much longer I'll be able to live with those kids,

1194
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:03,430
and when you say Kaoru and Tomoki's future,

1195
01:22:03,430 --> 01:22:06,430
I don't really know what I can do about it after all.

1196
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:14,440
So it may sound irresponsible to you, but

1197
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:17,440
I'm cherishing the moment.

1198
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:25,450
I'm a fool, aren't I?

1199
01:22:25,450 --> 01:22:28,450
Always acting on impulse and doing things like this.

1200
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:38,460
But I'm determined to do anything so they're happy now,

1201
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:41,460
that no one's going to beat me in that determination.

1202
01:22:45,470 --> 01:22:47,470
You know,

1203
01:22:47,470 --> 01:22:52,480
those guys eat rice sprinkled with just goma shio like it's the most delicious thing.

1204
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:55,480
With a happy look on their face.

1205
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:01,480
I want them to remember that

1206
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:04,480
feeling of being happy for the moment.

1207
01:23:08,490 --> 01:23:14,490
I think what's necessary for the future may be a happy now.

1208
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:20,500
I want them to have lots of happy moments like that.

1209
01:23:22,510 --> 01:23:24,510
If I can do that for them,

1210
01:23:24,510 --> 01:23:28,510
I won't be anxious whenever the time comes for us to part.

1211
01:23:52,510 --> 01:23:54,530
I regained my composure a bit after seeing the kappa.

1212
01:23:56,540 --> 01:23:59,540
Kappa? What's this?

1213
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:02,480
We're coming home once.

1214
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:09,490
Thank you so much for everything.

1215
01:24:09,490 --> 01:24:13,490
I don't know what will happen, but I'll talk it over with Daisuke one more time.

1216
01:24:15,490 --> 01:24:17,490
Shota-kun, Nana-chan. I'm happy for you.

1217
01:24:17,490 --> 01:24:20,490
Come visit us again, okay?

1218
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,500
Daisuke.

1219
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,510
-Dad.
-Did you come to get us?

1220
01:24:30,510 --> 01:24:33,510
What happened?

1221
01:24:33,510 --> 01:24:35,510
Nothing.

1222
01:24:37,510 --> 01:24:41,520
Senpai, looks like we put you through a lot of trouble.

1223
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,520
Thank you for everything.

1224
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:46,520
You have to come to Yamanashi again, okay?

1225
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:48,520
Yeah. Promise.

1226
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:51,530
Okay, let's get going.

1227
01:24:51,530 --> 01:24:56,530
Kaoru Purple. Tomoki Purple.
We shall meet again.

1228
01:24:56,530 --> 01:24:58,470
-Roger.
-Roger.

1229
01:24:58,470 --> 01:25:00,470
Cool. Grape Warriors.

1230
01:25:03,470 --> 01:25:06,480
Let's go then.

1231
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:09,480
See you.

1232
01:25:18,490 --> 01:25:20,490
Nana Purple. Bye bye.

1233
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:22,490
Shota Purple. Bye bye.

1234
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:35,510
Marumo, we got to see the kappa.

1235
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:38,510
We got to tell him our wishes too.

1236
01:25:38,510 --> 01:25:40,510
-Thanks, Marumo.
-Thanks.

1237
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:42,510
Is that right? I'm happy for you.

1238
01:25:42,510 --> 01:25:46,520
So Shota-kun and his family's alright now, they made up, right?

1239
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:49,520
Yeah, I think so.

1240
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:56,530
Kaoru, what's wrong? Huh?

1241
01:25:56,530 --> 01:26:01,460
What, Tomoki. What, you too, Tomoki?
What, what, what, what? What's wrong?

1242
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:04,470
Now that Shota-kun and Nana-chan's gone,

1243
01:26:04,470 --> 01:26:07,470
it hurts around here.

1244
01:26:07,470 --> 01:26:11,470
Yeah, me too.

1245
01:26:11,470 --> 01:26:16,480
Maybe our hearts got linked together.

1246
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:23,490
Yeah, maybe when you care for someone, your hearts get linked together, huh?

1247
01:26:23,490 --> 01:26:29,490
Shota-kun and Nana-chan's mommy was smiling and looked happy, huh?

1248
01:26:29,490 --> 01:26:31,490
Yeah.

1249
01:26:31,490 --> 01:26:35,490
Shota-kun and Nana-chan looked happy too.

1250
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:41,500
They were smiling because their hearts are linked together, right?

1251
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:46,510
Yeah, you're right.

1252
01:26:46,510 --> 01:26:51,510
That's right. Let's write an okite.

1253
01:27:09,470 --> 01:27:12,470
If we believe?

1254
01:27:12,470 --> 01:27:14,470
our hearts will link together?

1255
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:18,470
Yes. The important thing is to not give up and keep on believing.

1256
01:27:31,490 --> 01:27:34,490
If you believe,

1257
01:27:34,490 --> 01:27:36,490
-you may even see a kappa?
-Yeah.

1258
01:27:36,490 --> 01:27:38,490
That's why you got to see the kappa, right?

1259
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:45,500
Do you think Kappa-san will grant us our wish too?

1260
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:48,500
We threw in a bonus wish, huh?

1261
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:50,510
Huh~.

1262
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:52,510
What, what, what? What did you wish for?

1263
01:27:52,510 --> 01:27:54,510
It's a secret.

1264
01:27:54,510 --> 01:27:56,510
-What?
-Secret.

1265
01:27:56,510 --> 01:27:58,450
-What is it? Tell me.
-No.

1266
01:27:58,450 --> 01:28:04,450
Why?
Tell me, tell me, tell...

1267
01:28:04,450 --> 01:28:07,460
Anyway, let's eat.

1268
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:11,460
Is that right?
I'm happy for Shota-kun and Nana-chan.

1269

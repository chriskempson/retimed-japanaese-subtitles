1
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,290
What's a family?

2
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,300
Does it mean you're related by blood?

3
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,300
Does it mean you live together?

4
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,310
No matter how well you know the person,

5
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:40,320
you don't really know what he's thinking and

6
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,320
and what he's feeling in his heart.

7
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:52,330
Even if you're real a family.

8
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,330
What's a family?

9
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,360
What is it that bonds people together?

10
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,280
I never even thought about it before.

11
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:34,310
Takagi  Takagi  Takagi  Takagi.

12
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,310
Then who's this.

13
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,310
-I'm gonna take a guess.
-Okay, who is it.

14
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,310
Bryant.
Bryant.

15
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,320
Saeki  Saeki  Saeki.

16
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,320
Wrong, wrong, wrong.  A foreigner.

17
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,320
-Ogilvie.
-Right answer.

18
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,330
Here you go, yaki onigiri*.
(*grilled rice ball)

19
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,330
Okay, here it is, the last one.

20
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,330
Who's this, who's this?

21
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,270
Hey, Mamoru, where's Sasakura?

22
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,270
Sasakura?
Don't ask me, I'm busy now.

23
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,280
Hey, Sasakura.

24
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,280
Sorry, I'm late.

25
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,280
Hey guys, our ace is here.
I propose another toast.

26
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,290
To our reunion. Cheers.

27
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,290
Cheers.

28
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:32,300
Hey. You haven't changed at all.

29
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,300
Hey, you're looking good.

30
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,310
Excuse me, excuse me.
Mamoru, it's been while

31
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,310
Don't come squeezing into this tight spot.

32
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:48,310
-Work keeping you busy?
-Yeah, obviously.

33
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,320
-Super busy.
-Product development for an office supply company

34
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,320
-keeps you that busy?
-Well, I'm not in product development anymore.

35
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,320
I kinda left there last month.

36
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,320
Why? Did something happen?

37
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,340
Enough about that.
Things happen.

38
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,260
Aren't you handling complaints now?

39
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:08,270
Will you stop calling it that.

40
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:12,270
Take a good look. Read it.

41
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:16,280
"Akebono Office Supplies.
Customer Service"?

42
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,280
We get calls from all kinds of people.

43
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,280
Things must be tough everywhere.
Here, let me make you feel better.

44
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,280
Huh?

45
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,290
Cut it out.
I'm not interested in other people's kids.

46
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:32,290
-They've sure grown.
-Let me see.

47
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,300
Even though they're twins, they're so different.

48
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,300
Kinda like Zashiki-warashi vs Jizou*?
(*a girl spirit vs Buddhist deity)

49
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,300
They're fraternal twins so their personalities are totally different too.

50
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,300
The older one's sassy, the younger one's a baby.

51
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:51,310
I'd go through anything for these guys.

52
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,310
I can't even imagine what that's like.

53
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,310
I guess it would be impossible for you.

54
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,320
Hey, if you're having a hard time, look for a new wife.

55
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,250
I have no intention of marrying again.
I'm managing somehow.

56
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,260
But aren't you looking a little haggard?

57
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,260
-It must be tough taking care of twins.
-Well, yeah.

58
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,260
But it's a good thing for the kids.

59
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,270
They've been together since they were born.

60
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,270
Even during sad times, they'll have each other.

61
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,270
Is that how it is?

62
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:21,270
Yeah.
I'm really glad they're twins.

63
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:24,270
Thanks to being twins, they've always been happy.

64
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,280
Oh, do you remember?

65
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,300
-Kimura
-Kimura

66
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,300
Hey, Kimura.
Kimura, are you alright?

67
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:04,250
Catcher Takagi-kun, coming in for Kimura-kun.

68
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:09,250
Catcher Takagi-kun

69
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,250
Throw me your best pitch.

70
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,260
Let's crank it up.

71
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:58,300
We had fun back then, didn't we?
Thanks to Mamoru, I was able to pitch as I liked.

72
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,300
I didn't want to pitch around them and lose.

73
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,250
Hey you two partners in crime shouldn't be having a heart to heart. That should've been an intentional walk, right?

74
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,250
That was the first official game for me, you know.

75
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,250
There was no way I was going be uncool and give up a walk from the start.

76
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,250
Right?

77
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:19,260
This is embarrassing. How can you write something like this.

78
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,260
What does it say?

79
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,270
"Battery for life"

80
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,270
-Why'd you bring it all of sudden?
-Never mind that. I'll give it to you.

81
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:31,270
-I don't want it.
-Just keep it.

82
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,270
What an embarrassing guy.

83
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:51,290
-Are you nervous?
-No, I'm not.

84
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,290
The other party will be saying whatever she wants,

85
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,290
but don't give in.

86
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,300
Okay.

87
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,300
We are very sorry for what happened.

88
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,230
The fact that you're apologizing must mean you're taking responsibility.

89
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:07,240
Well, before we get into that, if you would allow us to

90
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,240
confirm the circumstances once more...

91
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,240
Never mind the circumstances or whatever.

92
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,250
Do you realize I'm hurt?

93
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,250
Because of that, I've had to go to the hospital and

94
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,250
I've been irritated all morning because of the pain.

95
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,250
It's causing me extreme mental distress.

96
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,250
Yes, however...

97
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,250
You're absolutely right.
How is your injury?

98
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,260
-Look.
-Oh my.

99
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,260
It must have hurt quite a bit?

100
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,270
The pain wasn't that bad, but

101
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:38,270
it bled, you see, so I was alarmed.

102
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,270
I totally understand.

103
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,280
By the way, how did it happen?

104
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,280
This.

105
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,280
Thank you for buying the staple of our company,

106
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,280
the ball point pen with vivid black ink.

107
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,280
Like this.

108
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,290
You took off the cap.

109
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,290
You're saying you used it as an ear cleaner.

110
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,310
And then, I got a cut, like this.

111
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:04,230
-I see.
-However, ma'am,

112
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,230
the cap of the pen isn't made to be an ear cleaner.

113
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,230
But it doesn't say that, does it?

114
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,240
That's not written anywhere, is it?
If it can't be used that way,

115
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,240
how are we supposed to know if it doesn't say it can't be used that way.

116
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,240
Yes, however...

117
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,250
It's not much, but if you don't mind, please accept them.

118
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,250
Wait, what?

119
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:28,250
It's not that I wanted something, you know.

120
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:32,250
Thank you very much for your valuable suggestion.

121
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,270
We're back.

122
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,270
-Takagi-kun.
-Yes.

123
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,280
How was your first customer visit?

124
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,280
I was betrayed by Mashima.
Yes, he totally betrayed me.

125
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,280
-What do you mean "betray?"
-You switched sides without warning.

126
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,280
-You made it look like the bad guy.
-That wasn't betrayal.

127
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,220
It's a technique.
The important thing is to

128
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,220
get on the other party's good side like that.

129
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,220
Will you tell me beforehand if you're gonna do something like that?

130
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,230
-Didn't I tell you?
-Samejima-san, this guy sucks.

131
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,230
Don't bother telling Samejima-san.
He's the one

132
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,230
who taught me that technique.

133
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,230
Can you teach me too?

134
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,240
-Takagi-san.
-Yes.

135
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,240
Please turn in your report.

136
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,240
Please be as specific as possible, like what measures you took

137
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,250
and if any apology gifts were given.

138
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,250
It's almost time for PR to be here, so please hurry.

139
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,250
Excuse me, but who's coming from PR?

140
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,250
Recently Makimura-san's been coming a lot.

141
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,260
Oh, Makimura-san.

142
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,260
Hold on please.

143
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,260
Takagi-san, a customer wants to speak with you.

144
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,260
Me?

145
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,270
You'd better be careful with these calls that specifically ask for you.

146
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,270
What?  Really?

147
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:56,280
Hello, this is Takagi.

148
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,280
You know, your company's eraser

149
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,280
doesn't erase at all.
Did you intend for it to erase?

150
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,280
We're very sorry.

151
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,290
If you're sorry, stick out your butt.
I'm gonna whoop your ass with a bat, you bastard.

152
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:12,290
You must be Sasakura.

153
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,290
You got it.

154
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,300
Hey, quit messing around.

155
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,300
-Looks like you're working diligently.
-Of course I am.

156
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,300
I sure had fun at the get-together.

157
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,310
Did you call just to say that?

158
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:31,310
We couldn't really talk the other night because of all the noise, right?

159
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,310
-What do we have to talk about anyway.
-Don't be like that.

160
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:37,320
Takagi-san.
Makimura-san's here.

161
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,320
-Mamoru...
-Hello.

162
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,320
Actually, I...

163
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,320
Sasakura, I can't talk now, I'm busy.
Okay, later.

164
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,320
Are you done with all the reports?

165
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,330
This is the last one so

166
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,330
I'll bring it to you by the end of the day.
Directly.

167
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,330
Oh, then just give me the ones that are done.

168
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,330
Oh, alright.

169
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,340
Looks like you're getting acclimated to Customer Service.

170
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,340
Yes, more or less.
Tami-san, the reports.

171
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,270
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

172
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:04,280
Thank you.
Bye.

173
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,290
How come he hasn't changed the light bulb yet.

174
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,300
-Thanks.
-Oh, thank

175
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,300
you. Come again.

176
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,310
-Pops.
-Oh, you're back.

177
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,310
-About the light bulb in the stairway.
-Oh yeah, the light bulb.

178
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,320
-Here.
-Hey, watch it.

179
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,320
-Use that.
-Am I changing it?

180
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
You're the only one who uses it.

181
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,320
Come on.

182
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,330
What a pain.

183
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,330
He's nothing more than a maintenance fee thief.

184
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,280
I'm home.

185
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,280
"I'm home"?

186
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,290
Aya, why are you here suddenly?

187
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:28,290
Oh, you said your back was hurting so I came to check up on you.

188
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:34,300
My back?
I hurt my back last year.

189
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,300
What's the difference if I'm worried about it now.

190
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,300
Aren't you happy to see me?

191
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,310
Not particularly.

192
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,310
Pops, here's the old one.

193
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,320
Hey.

194
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,340
Where are you going to sleep?

195
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,260
What about the room upstairs?

196
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,260
-Upstairs?
-Yeah.

197
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,260
I rented it out.

198
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,270
Oh.

199
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:11,270
It's tight, but I'll guess I'll have to make do down here.

200
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,270
Stop being so selfish, will you?

201
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:17,280
In the first place, I don't have any futon ready

202
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,280
-and it's too cold on the couch.
-That's alright.

203
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,280
It's gotten a lot warmer now.

204
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,280
Still...

205
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,290
I told you it's alright. You never minded being cold, Dad.

206
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:31,290
So it's me who gets the couch.

207
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:35,290
That's a given. What are you talking about?

208
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,300
Alright.

209
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,300
I'll be going back up then.

210
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,300
-Make yourself at home.
-Thanks.

211
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,300
Hey, I'm hungry.

212
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,310
-What do you want?
-Who is that?

213
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,310
Oh yeah, I want Kuji Rice.

214
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,260
-Hello?
-Hello, it's Kubo.

215
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:16,260
Hey, don't be calling me at work.

216
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,260
The other day too, that idiot Sasakura...

217
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,270
-Mamoru.
-Huh?

218
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,270
Sasakura...

219
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,270
What about Sasakura?

220
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:30,280
He passed away this morning.

221
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,280
Hey, Sasakura did what?

222
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:40,290
Hey, what about Sasakura?

223
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,290
I said he died.

224
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,300
Mamoru.

225
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,300
That guy.

226
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,240
He wasn't doing well.

227
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,240
Terminal cancer.

228
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:12,250
Did you know about it?

229
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,250
Well, yeah.

230
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,260
If you knew, why didn't you tell me?

231
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:23,260
Sorry, but Sasakura asked me not to tell you.

232
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,260
Sorry don't cut it.

233
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,260
If you knew about his illness, what would you have done?

234
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:35,270
I would've, well, at least in the end

235
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:40,280
been nicer to him, or been like better friends.

236
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,280
Don't you think that's exactly what Sasakura didn't want?

237
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:50,280
Isn't it sadder if someone suddenly starts acting nice and friendlier because it's the end?

238
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:55,290
You'd think "Ah, so this is finally the end."

239
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:03,300
It would be meaningless to see you if it wasn't the usual you.

240
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,240
What's that supposed to mean.

241
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:43,270
What happened to you suddenly.

242
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,270
Why aren't you saying anything.

243
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,290
You should've told me if you were going to die.

244
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,290
You should've told me.

245
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,240
Daddy?

246
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:26,250
It's hard to breath with that handkerchief on your face, isn't it?

247
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:30,260
No, this is...

248
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,260
Tomoki, come here.

249
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:50,270
Tomoki, I found a piece of paper.

250
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:57,280
Here, hold this...

251
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,220
What? Why are you saying that now, Onii-chan?

252
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,220
Didn't you promise Junichiro that you'd take both of them?

253
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,230
Well yeah, I did say that at the hospital, but...

254
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,230
Why did you lie?

255
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,230
Under that circumstance, I had no choice but to say that to put his mind at ease.

256
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:16,230
Then what are we going to do?

257
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,240
We can manage to take one.

258
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,240
What's that.
You mean split them up?

259
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,240
We have to send money back home too so we're overloaded.

260
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,250
We're all in the same boat, aren't we?
We

261
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,250
have our hands full with just Reina too.

262
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,250
Then shall we send one to an institution?

263
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,250
What are you saying?
That makes me look totally...

264
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,260
Aren't I going to be with Tomoki?

265
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,260
That's right.

266
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,270
Tomoki's going to sleep at Uncle's house from now on.

267
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,270
Kaoru's going to Auntie's house.

268
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:54,270
But we promised Daddy that we'll stay together.

269
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:58,280
You know, your daddy told me

270
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,280
that it's better if you slept over separately

271
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,280
so that Kaoru and Tomoki would get stronger.

272
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,280
But, but, Daddy didn't tell us anything like that.

273
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,290
Is that right?

274
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:12,290
But it's your daddy's wish that you two grow up to be strong.

275
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:15,290
Let's work at it, huh?

276
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:19,290
But we promised.

277
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,300
It's a good thing for the kids.

278
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,310
They've been together since they were born.

279
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,310
Even during sad times, they'll always have each other.

280
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,360
Go on, say bye bye to Onee-chan.

281
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,360
No, I won't.

282
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,280
Look Tomoki, Onee-chan's doing bye bye.

283
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,290
No, I'm not doing bye bye.

284
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:16,290
Tomoki, we have to bye bye.

285
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:22,290
No, I don't want to.

286
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,300
Tomoki, do what you're told.

287
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,300
I'm not doing it no matter what.

288
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:38,310
Okay, we're leaving.
Let's go.

289
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:42,310
-Tomoki.
-Tomoki.

290
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,310
Come on.

291
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,320
-Onee-chan.
-Tomoki.

292
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,320
I'm going with Onee-chan.

293
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,320
Kaoru, shall we go?

294
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,270
Onee-chan.

295
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:15,280
Onee-chan, Onee-chan
Onee-chan, Onee-chan.

296
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,250
Kaoru's going to be staying here from now on, right?

297
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,250
Of course.

298
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,260
Do I have to share my room from now on too?

299
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:55,260
You don't mind it being a little tight, do you?

300
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:58,260
I do mind. I have entrance exams this year, you know?

301
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,260
Don't force entrance exams into the subject.

302
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,270
Then don't you care if I don't study?

303
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,270
We don't have any other room.

304
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,270
We can't make Kaoru sleep here, can we?

305
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,270
Forget it.

306
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:30,290
Auntie's going back to the shop.

307
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,300
Can you eat by yourself?

308
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,300
Yes, I'll be alright.

309
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,300
Itadakimasu.

310
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,250
Auntie.

311
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,260
Thank you.

312
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,260
Thank you. That comes to 368 yen.

313
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,260
Yes, what can I get you.

314
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:18,280
What are you doing?
Did you spill?

315
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,280
I'm sorry.

316
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,280
Hey, Tomoki spilled the miso soup.

317
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,280
Take care of him properly, will you.

318
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,290
I can't get away now, so wait a while.

319
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:35,290
Stay away from that.

320
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,290
I'm sorry.

321
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,250
Hello. Thank you for calling

322
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:01,250
Akebono Office Supplies Customer Service.
-This is Mashima.

323
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,260
Yes, yes.

324
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:08,260
We're very sorry.
Yes.

325
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:13,260
Oh, is that right?
Specifically, the merchandise is...

326
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,270
I'm gonna whoop your ass with a bat, you bastard.

327
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:21,270
You must be Sasakura.

328
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,270
Looks like you're working diligently.

329
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,280
Thank you for calling Akebono Office Supplies Customer Service.

330
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,290
This is Takagi.
-Hello, you know,

331
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,290
the ink in this is all hard and won't come out.

332
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:39,290
What's the deal?

333
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:42,290
Are you listening?

334
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,260
I'm very sorry for the inconvenience.

335
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:48,260
Yes. And this product you're talking about is....

336
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,140
I'm leaving your lunch here.
You'll be alright?

337
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:00,140
-Try not to spill anymore, okay?
-Okay.

338
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:04,150
Call me right away if something happens.
You can't do anything by yourself.

339
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:07,150
-Okay.
-Excuse me.

340
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:10,150
Yes, coming.

341
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:05,260
-Hello.
-Mamoru, you at work now?

342
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,260
Yeah, what's up?

343
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:10,260
Remember Sasakura's kids?
The twin boy.

344
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,260
Oh, yeah, that one that looks spaced out.

345
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:15,270
Yeah.  I got a call telling me that he disappeared.

346
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:18,270
Seems he was there this morning, but would you happen to know where he went?

347
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:22,270
-No, I have no idea.
-Yeah, I guess you wouldn't.

348
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,280
That's okay then.
Thanks.

349
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,280
No, I'm not doing bye bye.

350
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,290
Tomoki, we have to bye bye.

351
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:37,290
-Onee-chan.
-Tomoki.

352
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:40,290
I'm going with Onee-chan.

353
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,320
-We're going.
-Oh, okay.

354
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,240
Look what happened when I used it.
The document's all smeared.

355
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,240
We're very sorry.

356
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,240
If you don't mind, can you tell us how

357
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,240
you had it stored?

358
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,250
What difference does that make.

359
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,250
Hey, you.
Have you been listening?

360
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:07,250
Pardon?
Oh yes, we're very sorry.

361
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,250
You'd better be listening, idiot.

362
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:13,260
It's a waste of time talking to you guys.
Bring someone higher up.

363
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:18,260
This isn't looking good.  It might drag on.

364
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,260
Let's go back and ask for Samejima-san's advice.

365
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:31,280
-Takagi-san.
-Huh?

366
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,280
You've been spacing out.

367
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,290
Sorry, Mashima, but can you go back first?

368
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:43,290
Are you going somewhere?

369
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:46,290
Really sorry.

370
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,290
Wait.

371
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,250
Hey, what's up?

372
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,250
Are you Daddy's friend?

373
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,250
Yup.

374
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,260
Tomoki disappeared.

375
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,260
Is everyone looking for him now?

376
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,260
-Yes.
-Well, then

377
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,260
-they might find him right away.
-They'll never find him.

378
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,260
I just know he's lost.

379
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,270
-They'll find him.
-I'm gonna go look for him.

380
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,270
Hey, wait.
Wait a minute.

381
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,270
If you go, there'll just be one more lost kid.

382
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,270
-I can find him.
-Calm down.

383
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:39,280
They'll find him.
He'll be alright.

384
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,280
But Daddy wasn't alright.

385
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:48,290
He said he was alright, but he died.

386
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,220
Tomoki might not be alright too.

387
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:54,220
I said calm down.

388
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:58,220
If Tomoki goes away too, I'll be all alone.

389
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:15,250
Okay. But you can't go by yourself.
I'll go with you, okay?

390
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,250
Yes.

391
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:23,250
It's so out of the blue, I have no idea where to start.

392
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:26,260
Tomoki's probably trying to go back to our old house.

393
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:30,260
So...that way?

394
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,280
I'm tired.

395
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:11,230
Are you lost?

396
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,240
I'm lost too.  We're the same.

397
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:25,250
I'll go take a look so you stay here.

398
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:29,250
-He won't be at this park.
-Why not?

399
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:31,250
Because of that.

400
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:37,260
He doesn't like that kind of scary things.

401
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,260
Is he really a boy?

402
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,260
He's a real wimp.

403
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:45,270
It's amazing he had the guts to run away from home.

404
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,300
Let's go that way.

405
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:51,270
Where am I?

406
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:11,290
Onee-chan.

407
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:22,290
Daddy.  Daddy.

408
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,250
Don't cry.

409
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,260
Can..Can you talk?

410
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,260
Of course I can.

411
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:01,270
What's your name?

412
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:05,270
I'm Sasakura Tomoki. I'm 6 years old.

413
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:26,230
He's not here.

414
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:30,230
You don't see him, do you? Let's move on.

415
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:33,230
Found him.  He's here.

416
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:54,650
This is Takagi.
Yes, we found him.

417
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:57,650
Oh, sorry, the sister's with me too.

418
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:59,660
We were searching together.

419
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:02,660
Well, she insisted, so...

420
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,660
This place?  Where is this place?

421
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,660
Tomoki, wake up.

422
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:11,670
-Onee-chan?
-Sh.

423
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:14,670
-We're gonna have to run away.
-Huh? Where?

424
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:17,670
Never mind, just run away with me.

425
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,680
Yes, good bye.

426
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:33,690
Huh? Where did they go?

427
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,700
Hey wait, what's going on?
Where are you going?

428
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,700
This way, this way, Tomoki.
This way.

429
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,700
Hey.

430
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,640
Hey, wait, hey.

431
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,650
-Let go.
-Why are you running away?

432
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:00,650
I don't want to be separated.
I want to be with Tomoki.

433
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:03,650
-That's not possible.
-Why?

434
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:10,660
What can you do?
There's this thing called grown-ups' circumstances.

435
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:14,660
You can't stay together.

436
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,660
We promised Daddy.

437
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:22,670
Daddy told us

438
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:26,670
"You guys have to stay together no matter what."

439
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,680
It's a good thing for the kids.

440
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,680
They've been together since they were born.

441
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,690
Even during sad times, they'll always have each other.

442
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:37,690
I'm really glad they're twins.

443
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:40,690
Thanks to being twins, they've always been happy.

444
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:49,720
Daddy's gone, and I don't want to be separated from Tomoki too.

445
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,640
Don't be mean to Onee-chan.

446
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,650
That hurt, kid.

447
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,650
Tomoki.

448
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:21,660
Okay, okay.

449
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:25,670
You guys wanna come to my place?

450
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,670
-What?
-What?

451
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:31,670
If you want to be together that much, come to my place.

452
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,670
Really?

453
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,680
Don't run away anymore, okay?

454
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,680
-Yes.
-Yes.

455
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,690
Hey, you go away.

456
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:47,690
-Come on.
-Let's go, let's go.

457
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:55,630
Yes, yes.
Yes, they got me good.

458
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,630
They say they're not going back.

459
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:03,640
Well, it's late, plus it seems they want to stay together a bit longer. Yes.

460
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:07,640
Besides, having walked around so much, they look tired.

461
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,650
I'll take them to my place for today.

462
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:13,650
Yes. Good bye.

463
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,670
Listen, walk quietly and slowly, okay?

464
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:36,670
Hey you, why are you following us?

465
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:39,680
No, the dog too.

466
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,680
You don't expect me to take the dog too, do you?

467
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,680
Pets aren't allowed in my room.

468
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,690
Besides, I'm renting the room on the condition I live alone, so

469
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:51,620
you guys being here is a secret too.

470
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:55,630
But he's gonna be all alone.

471
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,630
He'll be fine. He'll eventually go back to his owner if you leave him alone.

472
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:00,630
-No!
-Stop it~ Hush.  You're too noisy.

473
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:06,640
Alright. Just to the front door then.

474
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,640
Yes!

475
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:47,670
Go in.

476
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:52,620
Hello~.

477
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:14,640
Okay, I'll fix you something to eat so go take a bath together.

478
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,640
Alright~.

479
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,640
Here it goes.

480
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:26,650
-Were you totally surprised?
-No.

481
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:49,260
When is this from? Oh well.

482
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:59,270
-We're done with the bath.
-Hey, wait.

483
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:04,270
You're wet, you're wet.
Hold on, I said you're wet.

484
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:06,280
But we couldn't find any towels.

485
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,280
Towel?

486
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:13,280
Oh, that's right. Wait a sec.
Um...er...here.

487
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:17,290
Here.

488
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:22,290
Don't move.

489
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:26,290
You're gonna catch a cold if you don't dry your hair right away.

490
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:38,240
Is this too extravagant for them?

491
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,250
-Be quiet, be quiet.
-I'm scared!

492
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,250
Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet, be quiet. Listen.

493
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,250
It's alright, alright, alright.
Listen, listen, listen.

494
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,250
Don't move, okay?
I'll go look for a flashlight,

495
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:51,250
-so wait here.
-I'm scared.

496
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:54,260
It's not scary, not scary, not scary...
It's not scary.

497
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,260
Look, look at this.

498
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,260
Sing a song for him.

499
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:05,270
That song's scary.
That's too depressing.

500
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:08,270
Sing him a more cheerful song.  Yeah, a more cheerful song.

501
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:11,270
"Who's scared of ghosts.
There's no such thing as ghosts."

502
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:15,280
"Someone half asleep must have made a mistake."

503
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,280
"But just a little,
just a little"

504
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,280
"I'm scared too."

505
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:33,300
No! My canned mackerel!

506
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,300
Hey, stop, stop.

507
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:39,240
Hey, put it away, put it away.

508
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,240
-This should be it.
-Alright.

509
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,240
Please sign here.

510
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,250
Yes, yes.  Sign here.

511
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,250
Okay, thanks.

512
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:57,250
Thank you.

513
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:00,260
-Did the package come?
-Huh? Yeah.

514
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,260
What are they?

515
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:05,260
Just some daily necessities and stuff?

516
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:09,270
You're trying to move back, aren't you?

517
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:11,270
Huh?

518
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:13,270
Isn't it kinda noisy up there?

519
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:16,270
Yeah.
Don't mind about upstairs and

520
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:19,280
answer me honestly.

521
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,280
It's nothing you have to be concerned with.

522
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,280
What's wrong with coming back to my own house?

523
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,280
Don't get defensive.

524
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,280
Besides, what are you going to do about your job?

525
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,290
I don't want any bums around here.

526
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:34,290
I'm in the process of deciding what to do.

527
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:38,230
Oh, I'll work here.
I'll give you break on my hourly wage too.

528
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:40,230
Don't be ridiculous.

529
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:46,240
Did something happen?

530
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,240
No, nothing's happened.

531
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:52,240
Would someone who had nothing happen

532
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,240
quit her job and move out of her place?

533
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:02,250
Is it a guy?

534
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:07,250
I told you nothing happened.

535
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:19,270
-What's this?
-Can't you tell by looking?  It's Goma-Shio (sesame seed and salt).

536
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:21,270
-Goma shio?
-Goma shio?

537
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:25,270
When you get desperate for side dishes, goma shio is the boss.
That's how it's always been.

538
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:29,280
Go on, say hello.
Hello.

539
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,280
Hello, Boss.

540
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,280
-Where's the food to go with the rice?
-Don't have such a thing.

541
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,290
Daddy used to cook for us every day.

542
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:39,220
Can't do anything about that.
Daddy is daddy, and I'm me.

543
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:45,220
If you have any complaints, talk to the dog.
I'm mad too.

544
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,240
Okay, let's do "itadakimasu."

545
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,240
-Itadakimasu.
-Itadakimasu.

546
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,240
Itadakimasu.

547
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:09,250
It's good.
-It's good.

548
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:15,260
See? Isn't it?

549
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:17,260
Oji-san*.
(*term for older men)

550
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:19,260
Don't call me oji-san.

551
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,260
Then tell us your name.

552
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:25,270
Me? I'm Takagi Mamoru.

553
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:27,270
Takagi Marumo?

554
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:30,270
It's Mamoru.  Mamoru. What the heck is a Marumo?

555
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:33,280
Takagi Marumo.

556
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,300
He said Marumo. What a funny name.
That's funny.

557
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:40,220
Don't laugh. Don't laugh, munchkins.

558
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:48,220
Yes, hello.

559
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:51,230
-Is this Takagi-san?
-Yeah, what's up?

560
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:53,230
It's about the customer we visited today.

561
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:56,230
Yeah, what happened?

562
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:58,230
Samejima-san and I are going there first thing in the morning tomorrow,

563
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:02,240
so we were hoping you'd be there too.

564
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,240
Alright.  Thanks.  Oh!

565
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:08,240
Takagi-san?
What happened? Are you alright?

566
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,250
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'll see you tomorrow.

567
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:13,250
Hey you, what are you doing?

568
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:16,250
Hey, put it away, put it away.

569
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,220
That's right.

570
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:01,230
Hey, why didn't it go off.

571
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:04,230
-We turned it off.
-We turned it off.

572
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:08,230
Turned it off?  Are you serious? What the...

573
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,240
Listen, you guys be quiet, okay?

574
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,240
Okay~.  See you later.

575
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:22,250
Good morning.

576
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:24,250
It's not morning anymore.

577
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:26,260
-What happened with that customer?
-Nothing.

578
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,260
We'll have to go back there again some other time.

579
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:32,260
Since you didn't come.

580
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:34,260
I'm really sorry.

581
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:37,280
-Did you oversleep?
-I'll go over to

582
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,200
-visit the customer right now.
-No, don't bother.

583
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:44,210
You'll just be adding fuel to fire.
Let it sit overnight.

584
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:46,210
I'm sorry.

585
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:52,210
Oh.

586
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:56,220
Takagi-kun. That report you did the other day,

587
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:59,220
is this all?

588
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,220
Oh, that one about ear cleaner.

589
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:04,230
Yes, the customer accepted the apology gift so

590
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:07,230
we managed to get it resolved.
Didn't I write that in the report?

591
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:12,230
But she bled, didn't she?
It must have hurt.

592
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:15,240
Well, that's what she's saying, but...

593
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:20,240
The cap can be surprisingly dangerous, huh?

594
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,240
That's what you get for cleaning your ear with it.

595
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:27,250
I hate to bother you, but can you give this a little more thought?

596
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:29,250
No hurry.

597
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,200
Ouch.

598
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,210
-Preparations OK?
-OK!

599
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:52,210
We're gonna make this whole place clean.

600
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:58,210
What about this?

601
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:00,220
Trash.

602
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:03,220
-This and this too.  They're all trash.
-All trash.

603
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:05,220
Just throw everything away.

604
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:10,230
-What about this?
-It's broken.

605
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:12,230
It's broken so it's trash.

606
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:17,230
They're broken so they're all trash.
All trash.

607
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:24,240
-What about this?
-Trash.

608
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:28,240
Oh what about this?

609
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:32,250
Yuck~.

610
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:36,250
Trash, trash, trash, trash.

611
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,210
It's dirty.

612
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:58,210
This is trash too.

613
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:04,210
Go, mop.

614
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:07,220
Go, go, go.
Go, mop.

615
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,240
Hi.

616
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:48,260
-What are you doing?
-We cleaned the house.

617
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:50,260
We threw out the trash too.

618
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,260
Hey.

619
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,280
This ain't trash.

620
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:19,290
This too, this too.
They're not trash.

621
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:22,290
After all the cleaning we did.

622
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:25,290
Who asked you to clean the house.

623
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,240
Even though it may look like trash,

624
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:43,250
there's something that  should never get thrown away.

625
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:45,250
Mind your own business.

626
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:47,250
I'm sorry.

627
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:51,250
Seriously.

628
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:03,270
Onee-chan, I want to see Daddy.

629
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:13,280
Daddy wouldn't get mad at us like this.

630
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:18,280
It's my treasure, okay?
Wouldn't you get mad if someone threw yours away?

631
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:25,290
Daddy would have praised us if we cleaned the house.

632
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:28,290
What's there to praise.

633
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:31,290
Doing unnecessary things when I didn't even ask you to.

634
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:35,300
Daddy would have forgiven us if we apologized.

635
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:39,240
I'm not your daddy.
Stop acting like a baby.

636
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,240
-Daddy would have...
-Daddy isn't here anymore!

637
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,250
He's dead already.

638
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:02,250
We know that.

639
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:10,260
We know that!

640
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:44,230
For life?

641
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,240
For life..that's a lie.

642
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,240
I'm really glad they're twins.

643
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,240
Thanks to being twins, they've always been happy.

644
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:05,250
What should I do?

645
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:09,250
I said some terrible things to your precious twins.

646
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:15,260
Hey, Marumo.

647
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:17,260
Huh?

648
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:23,270
You're the worst, you know.

649
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:27,270
What?

650
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:42,220
The worst, huh?

651
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:50,230
Yeah, I'm the worst.

652
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:09,240
Onee-chan, I'm tired.

653
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:17,250
Here, I'll give you a piggyback ride.

654
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:36,270
Marumo?

655
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:41,210
Hey munchkins.

656
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:45,210
Sorry.

657
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:50,220
For saying such terrible things.

658
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:58,230
I was in the wrong.

659
00:56:58,230 --> 00:57:00,230
Sorry.

660
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:07,230
Thanks for cleaning the house for me.

661
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:15,240
But I want you to understand that

662
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:21,250
Daddy isn't here anymore.

663
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:35,260
You miss him, don't you?

664
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:43,200
But you guys aren't the only ones.

665
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:50,210
I knew your daddy from way back too.

666
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:57,220
Ever since middle school when we were skinny kids with shaved heads,

667
00:57:57,220 --> 00:58:00,220
we were together.

668
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:06,230
We always practiced together.

669
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:13,230
Even when we both got all dirty in the mud,

670
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:19,240
we grit our teeth and practiced hard.

671
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:29,240
Even during tough times, I was able to go on because he was there.

672
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:35,250
I had fun because he was there.

673
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:44,200
I really loved to catch his pitches.

674
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,200
He wouldn't ease up on

675
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,200
not one, not one pitch.

676
00:58:56,210 --> 00:59:00,210
I'd sure love to catch that ball one more time.

677
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:11,230
How was I to know that he'd die.

678
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:14,230
No way.

679
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:21,240
Don't go and die without telling me.

680
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:24,240
Don't mess with me.

681
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:32,250
Don't leave me here by myself.

682
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:44,190
Are you alright?

683
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:48,190
I'm not alright.

684
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:56,200
I miss him, so it's okay, isn't it? Huh?

685
00:59:56,200 --> 01:00:02,200
There are times where grownups cry too. Right?

686
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:08,220
It's okay to cry if you want to cry. Right?

687
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:26,230
Okay, let's go home.

688
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:29,230
-Yes.
-Okay, let's go home.

689
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:42,250
-I'm hungry.
-Okay, let's grab something to eat before we go home.

690
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:44,250
-What do you want?
-Goma shio.

691
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,250
Goma shio.

692
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:49,250
-Don't get into that stuff.
-Goma shio.

693
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:03,270
Don't forget the canned mackerel too.

694
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:05,270
What~!

1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
After Daddy died, Kaoru and Tomoki were separated.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,010
But Daddy's friend Marumo

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,010
said we could live with him.

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,010
Along with a dog called Mook.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,010
That's so tacky~.

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,020
-Why? It's cute.
-You're kidding me.

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,020
We made an Okite* Notebook
(*rules/code)

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,020
so that the three of us can live together happily.

9
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,030
Kaoru and Tomoki are first graders now.

10
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:35,030
So this time the dog said "That's so tacky."

11
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:39,040
Yes.
The dog said "That's so tacky."

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,040
And you're saying that the children even talked with him.

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,050
Yes.
What does this mean?

14
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,050
Generally speaking,

15
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:57,060
I think you and the twins have the same symptoms.

16
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,060
What you have in common is

17
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:04,000
the fact that all of you just recently lost a loved one.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
-So what should we do?
-There are

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
several ways to treat auditory hallucination, but

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
in your case, the worst thing you can do

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,010
is to overreact.

22
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,010
Be careful not to overreact every time you have

23
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:23,010
an auditory hallucination, but don't ignore it either.

24
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:27,020
Just listen to the voice with a calm mind,

25
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:31,020
and try to appreciate the experience.

26
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,030
-I see.
-If you relax and accept it,

27
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,030
it may go away naturally.

28
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:42,030
Got it.
Relax, right? Relax.

29
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,040
Alright.

30
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,050
Before we being the class today, let's decide on the duties.

31
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,050
Have you all thought of which duty you might want?

32
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,050
Yes~.

33
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,990
I want health duty.

34
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,990
Me too. We get to take our classmates to the health room, right?

35
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,990
Yes.
But you'd better think twice if you think

36
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,000
you can skip out on classes.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Listen.
Duties aren't games.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I want you all to learn the importance

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,010
of doing your best through these duties.

40
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:25,010
And I want you to shine brilliantly.

41
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,010
-Brilliantly?
-Yes.

42
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:31,020
That's my dream as a first time first grade teacher.

43
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,020
What a small dream.

44
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,020
My dream's to be an astronaut.

45
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,020
Mine is Precure*.
(*anime series)

46
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,030
Okay, quiet now.

47
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,030
Anyway, our dream is not what matters now.

48
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,030
For the time being, let's decide on the duties.

49
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,030
Raise your hand for the duty you want.

50
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,040
If I get too many volunteers, we'll do rock paper scissors.

51
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,040
Okay, who wants the blackboard duty?

52
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,980
That's too bad.

53
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,990
Yeah.
They're talking about suing us.

54
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,990
Good morning.
What's wrong?

55
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,990
There's trouble in the PR department.

56
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,990
Takagi-kun,

57
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:19,000
I know it's sudden, but can you go to Tochigi tomorrow?

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
-Tochigi?
-Our flyer

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
looks exactly like that of a stationery maker in Tochigi.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
"Gentle to people, family budget , and earth"

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,010
The slogan's exactly the same.

62
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,010
-Seems ours came out later.
-You mean we copied them?

63
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,010
Well, when we checked with the production company,

64
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,010
they said they knew nothing about it.
They never saw this flyer either.

65
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,020
-Seriously?
-Well,

66
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,020
I suppose there could be such a coincidence.

67
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,020
But even if we didn't know about it,

68
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,020
the other company's been using this slogan since

69
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,030
last year, and since ours is for a new product

70
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,030
I guess there's not much we can say if they accuse us of stealing their slogan.

71
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,030
-It's going to be nasty.
-But why I am going?

72
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,030
Customer Service representatives are experts in dealing with claims.

73
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,040
I've been asked to send one representative.

74
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,060
You say expert, but

75
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,970
I haven't been here that long yet.

76
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,980
-It's more fitting that Mashima Senpai go.
-Why should I go...

77
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,980
It sounds like Makimura-san's going from

78
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,980
the PR Department as the person in charge of the flyer.

79
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,980
What? Makimura-san's going?

80
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,990
-So will you go?
-Yes. With pleasure.

81
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,990
Who wants the book duty?

82
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,990
Who wants the tidying up duty?

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Who wants the distributing duty?

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,010
Kubodera-san it is.
The last one is flower duty.

85
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,010
Onee-chan's so lucky to have the book duty.

86
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:43,010
I need one person for the last duty.
Who wants the flower duty.

87
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,010
Me, me.

88
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,020
Huh?

89
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,020
It sounds like too much work.

90
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,030
That's a girl's job.

91
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,030
Don't say such a thing.

92
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,030
So Sasakura Tomoki-san will have the flower duty.

93
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,970
Thanks for raising your hand.

94
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,970
I'm happy that you did.
Work hard to make a pretty flower will bloom.

95
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,980
Um...Yes.

96
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,980
I want some too.

97
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,980
Yeah, go , go. Put on lots.

98
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,980
Put on lots.

99
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,980
Thank you very much.

100
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,990
Thank you very much. Crunchy.

101
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,990
-Marumo, you look happy.
-Do I?

102
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:31,000
Oh, I have to go on a business trip tomorrow, okay?

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
-What's a business trip?
-That means I'm not going to my usual office,

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
but to a different place.

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,010
I have a very important business tomorrow.

106
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:44,010
I might be a little late getting home, but

107
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,010
you two be good and stay home.

108
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,010
Okay.

109
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,020
I'll let Oji-san downstairs know too.

110
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,020
Have him feed you dinner for the time being.

111
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,040
And, you guys.
About this guy, Mook...

112
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,960
Even if he talks, don't get rattled, remain calm, and act normal.

113
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,970
-Just relax.
-We're normal.

114
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,970
Okay.
Maybe it's normal for you guys.

115
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,970
But this is important, so I want you to listen.

116
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:16,970
Let's just chat with Mook only when the three of us are alone.

117
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,980
-Why?
-Because people will think

118
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,980
we're strange if they see us talking with Mook.

119
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,980
Anyway,

120
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,990
the only time you can chat with Mook is when you're at home. Okay?

121
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:32,990
Okay.
I don't really get it, but got it.

122
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,990
-Yeah, got it.
-Got it.

123
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,990
Okay, that's good.

124
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Maybe I'll ask her out for dinner.

125
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:56,010
[Thank you so much for coming today, Takagi-san.]

126
00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:00,990
[If you'd like, shall we have dinner before we go?]

127
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,860
Just kidding.

128
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,870
Marumo, I put your underwear in the washer.

129
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,870
Mook pooped.

130
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,870
Come on, don't talk about things like underwear and poop.

131
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,880
-There goes my thoughts of ro-man (romance)
-Marron?

132
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,880
-Ro-man.
-Look.

133
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,880
We decided duties today at school.

134
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,890
I'm going to be in charge of books.

135
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,890
You like books, don't you? What about you, Tomoki?

136
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,890
-Flower duty.
-What? What's flower duty?

137
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,890
Um..

138
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:46,900
I water the flower and give it water

139
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,900
and things like that.

140
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,900
All you do is water.
But

141
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,910
if you water too much, the flower's gonna die, you know.

142
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,910
Really?

143
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,910
This looks good.

144
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:03,950
What should I do? I don't want flower duty after all.

145
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,950
I don't want the flower to die!

146
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,950
It's not even blooming yet.

147
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,960
I blew it!

148
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,960
Tomoki, flower duty's the best.

149
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,960
Ultraman and

150
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,960
Gachapin, and Gundam

151
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,970
all had flower duty, you know.

152
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,970
Really? Awesome!

153
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,970
Then what do I do?
What should I do to make the flower bloom?

154
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,970
Huh, Marumo, tell me.
Huh, Marumo.

155
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,980
Well, um...you have to do...that...you know.

156
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,980
It'll grow if you cast a magical spell...

157
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,980
-Probably.
-A magical spell?

158
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,990
-What kind of magic spell?
-Huh? Um...well...

159
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,990
Woo~ Mambo!

160
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,000
Cha-ra-ra-ra Woo~ Mambo?

161
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Right, right.
That's the magical spell.

162
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Got it.

163
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,940
Woo~ Mambo.

164
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,940
Mambo.

165
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,020
Did it sprout yet?

166
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,020
It's not going to sprout right away.

167
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,030
Yes. Alright.

168
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,030
Yes.
I'll let him know.

169
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,030
Chief, that was Takagi-san.

170
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,030
About the company in Tochigi...

171
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:16,040
The president was out and they were turned away at the door.

172
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,040
But he said he'll standby and wait with Makimura-san

173
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:23,040
-until they can see him.
-Alright.

174
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,050
I wonder if the president will see them.

175
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,050
-Maybe they'll have to wait until tomorrow.
-That means

176
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,050
-Takagi-san's spending the night with Makimura-san?
-What?

177
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,050
Something might happen.

178
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,060
Naw, naw.

179
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:43,000
Well, even if something happened, I sure envy carefree single people.

180
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Even if they have to suddenly spend the night away, they don't have anyone to worry about.

181
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Well, yes, that's true..

182
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Oh~!

183
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,010
-The twins.
-The twins?

184
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:58,010
No, um, tw--twist cap.
See this twist cap here...

185
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,020
Oh, there's Onee-chan's picture.

186
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,020
-Oh, I see Tomoki's picture there.
-Yeah.

187
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,030
Tomoki-kun's picture's weird.
There's no mommy in the family.

188
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:15,030
Kaoru-chan's too.

189
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,030
It's not weird.

190
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,030
But there's only your daddy.

191
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:22,040
That's not our daddy.

192
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,040
Then who is this person?

193
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,040
Marumo.

194
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,050
Is Marumo your daddy? Or your mommy?

195
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,050
Marumo is Marumo. He's not our daddy or mommy.

196
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:38,050
What~
It IS weird.

197
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:41,990
Marumo's amazing. He knows magical spells.

198
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,990
-Magical spells?
-You lie.

199
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,000
It's true.
It makes the flower grow.

200
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Then say it, this magical spell.

201
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Alright.

202
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:05,010
-What's that magical spell.
-Dorky~.

203
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:12,020
Wait, wait.
What's going on?

204
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:16,020
Sensei, Hayato-kun said Tomoki-kun's picture's weird.

205
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,030
You shouldn't be saying a thing like that.

206
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,030
But...

207
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:26,030
It's tough for Sasakura-san because they don't have their parents.

208
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,040
Don't you feel sorry for them?

209
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,040
You'd have a hard time too if you didn't have your mom and dad, right?

210
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,040
So I'm asking you all to be friends with them.

211
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,050
Try to get along. Okay?

212
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,050
Okay, let's begin the class.
Return to your seats.

213
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,990
Takagi-san, I'm really sorry about today

214
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,990
That's okay, it's my job.

215
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:57,000
I hope the president will understand.

216
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Yes.

217
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I was told by my boss to negotiate for a settlement out of court

218
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,010
if we ran into difficulty.

219
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,010
You mean settle it with money?

220
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:13,010
Yes.  I was told the money is ready.

221
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:18,020
All this happened because I was lacking as the person in charge.

222
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:22,020
Anyway, this is my fault.

223
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:28,030
I screwed up once too.

224
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:32,030
When I was on the product development team,

225
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:34,030
I got this idea to create a revolutionary product.

226
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,040
So I got the budget to do it and created it,

227
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,040
but it had some issues, and caused a huge loss.

228
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,980
Consequently, I was transferred to Customer Service.

229
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,980
Boy, was I mad at first.

230
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,980
I thought, why do I have to come to a place like this.

231
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,990
But recently, I began to think that

232
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:58,990
it's an important job to apologize sincerely too.

233
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:02,000
Takagi-san.

234
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
-Let's just apologize first and see what happens.
-Yes.

235
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I wonder if Takagi-san can get it done.

236
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
He might make them even madder.

237
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,010
-That's very likely.
-Or rather, was it really necessary

238
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:16,010
for us to send a representative in the first place?

239
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,010
The PR department should take care of it.

240
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:20,010
It's a good experience for Takagi-kun too.

241
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,020
Did you make him go on purpose?

242
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,020
Is everything going to be alright?
He's a little flaky.

243
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:29,020
I like the products he came up with.

244
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,030
Oh that one. That eraser that won't get smaller

245
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,030
-no matter how much you use it.
-Was there such a thing?

246
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:37,030
The phantom eraser we had to stop selling because the other

247
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,030
companies all complained that they wouldn't be able to sell their erasers.

248
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:43,030
He thinks of weird things, that guy.

249
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,980
Haruka-chan.
Do you want to come to my house today?

250
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,980
My mommy's going to bake a cake.

251
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,990
Manami-chan.

252
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:02,990
Oh, sorry Tomoki-kun, for talking about mommy.

253
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,990
No, that's okay. You don't have to mind me.

254
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,990
See you tomorrow. Bye bye.

255
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,990
Bye bye.

256
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:23,010
Woo~ Mambo.

257
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:25,010
Tomoki.

258
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,010
Onee-chan.

259
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:31,020
-Let's go home.
-Is it

260
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:35,020
weird that we don't have a mommy?

261
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,970
-Here. I borrowed this.
-Cinderella?

262
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,970
Cinderella didn't have a real mommy either.

263
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,970
But she lived happily ever after.

264
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:54,980
-Really?
-Yes, so we'll be fine. Let's go.

265
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,980
Okay.

266
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,980
CHI-YO-KO-RE-I-TO (chocolate)

267
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,980
Rock paper scissors!

268
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,990
PA-I-NA-TSU-PU-RU (pineapple)

269
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,990
It's Hayato-kun.

270
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Hayato-kun, aren't you going home?

271
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Your family's going to worry.

272
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,010
-None of your business.
-Hayato-kun.

273
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:31,010
You guys got it good.
Sensei doesn't get mad at you.

274
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,010
-Huh?
-He thinks you're pitiable because

275
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:38,020
you don't have parents. It's not fair.

276
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,020
-We're not pitiable.
-That's favoritism.

277
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,960
It's not favoritism.

278
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,960
But he's giving you special treatment because he thinks you're pitiable.

279
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,960
We're not pitiable.

280
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,960
You wanna fight?

281
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:57,970
Help! Onee-chan's fighting with Hayato-kun.

282
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,970
-With a boy?
-Is she hurt?

283
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:03,980
-There's blood.
-I'll be right there.

284
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,980
Aya, wait.

285
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:11,980
-Take this with you.
-Thanks. Where are they?

286
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,980
So the boy's the one who got hurt.

287
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:30,990
Kaoru-chan, did you apologize to Hayato-kun?

288
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,000
But I didn't do anything wrong.

289
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
But you made him get hurt.

290
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You guys make up, okay?

291
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:49,010
Hayato-kun, where's your house?
We'll take you home.

292
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,010
-Your mom must be worrying about you.
-Leave me alone!

293
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:54,020
Wait, Hayato-kun.

294
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:03,030
Isn't Hayato-kun home?

295
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:07,030
Doesn't look like anyone else is home either.

296
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:12,040
Excuse me.

297
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,060
This is Taniguchi-san's residence, isn't it?

298
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,970
Yes. But they won't be home until

299
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,980
later at night.

300
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,980
-They both work.
-What about Hayato-kun?

301
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,980
I think he's always watching TV by himself.

302
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,980
Maybe he went to the Children's Center.

303
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:40,000
So Hayato-kun's by himself all the time.

304
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Maybe he was lonely even though he has mommy and daddy.

305
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Maybe.

306
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:53,010
You should apologize to Hayato-kun at school tomorrow, okay?

307
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,010
For hurting him.

308
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,020
When you do something bad, you apologize.

309
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:04,020
Takagi-san does that kind of work every day, you know.

310
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:08,020
I think it's important to apologize.

311
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,020
Okay.

312
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:17,970
Marumo is family, isn't he?

313
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,970
Everyone said our family's weird today.

314
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,980
They asked who's Marumo.

315
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,980
Marumo's family, isn't he?

316
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,980
Even though we don't have daddy or mommy, Marumo's family, right?

317
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,990
That's right.

318
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:43,990
You're living together, so you're family.

319
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Okay, let's go.

320
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:03,010
Sasakura-san.

321
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:08,010
Sasakura-san. No one's home?

322
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:15,020
Excuse me?

323
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,960
Is that right.
That happened at school, huh?

324
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,970
Yes.

325
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,970
I've already cautioned the children in my class.

326
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:27,970
They're too young to be without parents.

327
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,970
I feel so sorry for them.

328
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:32,970
I'll do everything I can to support them.

329
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,980
Sensei.

330
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:41,990
I'm aware that I'm just an outsider and not their legal guardian or anything.

331
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,990
I know that, but

332
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:46,990
may I say something?

333
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,990
-Yes.
-Don't you think your attitude towards them

334
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:54,000
is hurting them even more?

335
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
But I'm just really concerned about those kids.

336
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I know.
I know that, and

337
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,010
I'm grateful that you were concerned enough to come

338
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:05,010
to see how they were doing.

339
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,010
But,

340
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,010
your feeling sorry for them is, in itself, mistaken.

341
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:12,020
Well, so

342
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,020
can you treat those kids more normally,

343
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,950
like other kids?

344
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:20,960
Without any special treatment, just normally.

345
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,970
Isn't that the president?

346
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,970
-Let's go.
-Yes.

347
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:42,980
Excuse me, we're from Akebono Office Supplies.

348
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:47,980
Akebono Office Supplies?
I don't have anything to say to you. Please leave.

349
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,990
We apologize for the trouble we've caused you.

350
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,990
We're very sorry.

351
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,990
It was really a coincidence.
It's not that we stole it.

352
00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:01,000
Whatever the reason, everyone thinks that we're the ones who copied you.

353
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
That's the disadvantage of being a small business out here in the provinces.

354
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
-However...
-We're being slandered on the internet,

355
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,010
and getting complaints and inquiries as to whether they're the same products.

356
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:12,010
Our reputation's been tattered.

357
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,010
Sir, in regards to that,

358
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,950
our attorney can work out something that's agreeable...

359
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,950
How can I be agreeable to anything.

360
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:21,950
Once the damage is done, you can't undo it.

361
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,960
You're an eyesore. Leave.

362
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,960
We're really sorry.

363
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,960
The responsibility is completely ours.

364
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,970
We recalled all the flyers as well.

365
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:38,970
So what.

366
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,970
That's not going to change anything for us.

367
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,970
Even so,

368
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,980
that's all we can do.

369
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:49,980
And apologize from the bottom of our heart.

370
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:53,980
-We're really sorry.
-Enough of that.

371
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,990
But there's nothing else we can do.

372
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,990
We're really sorry.

373
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,990
We're really sorry.

374
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
You came all the way from Tokyo just to say that?

375
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,940
You must have a lot of free time.

376
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:25,950
We're very sorry.

377
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:32,010
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

378
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,010
So Kaoru-chan has book duty and Tomo-kun has flower duty.

379
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:41,020
What duty did you have, Aya-chan?
Me?  I had...

380
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,020
What did I have?

381
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:48,030
Duty, huh? That was a long time ago.
One shiro-ae up.

382
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:51,030
Alright.  Just a minute, okay?

383
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,030
Didn't you have living creature duty?

384
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:58,040
Remember you used to take vegetables to feed the rabbit?

385
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:02,040
That's right.  I used to take care of Pii-chan, the rabbit.

386
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,040
That sounds so cool.

387
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,050
-Welcome.
-Are you full?

388
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:11,050
If you don't mind the counter, please come in.

389
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,050
We'll go back upstairs.

390
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:15,050
You can stay here as long as you want, you know.

391
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,060
But all we're just going to bed so....

392
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,060
Mook's there too so we'll be fine.

393
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:22,060
Are you sure?
I'll be up later on to check on you then.

394
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,060
Alright.

395
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:34,070
Here you go, Mook.
Sorry it's so late.

396
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:39,010
Onee-chan.

397
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:43,020
You know Cinderella.

398
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:47,020
She didn't have a real mommy, but I think she had a daddy.。

399
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,020
Did she?

400
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,030
See.

401
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:56,030
Is it different from the one I read?

402
00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:00,030
It's been a long time since I read "Cinderella."

403
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:03,040
Maybe we are pitiable because

404
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:07,040
we don't have mommy or daddy.

405
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:16,050
What? Really? What a relief.

406
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:20,050
Yes. Alright.
Thank you.

407
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,060
What a relief.

408
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,060
That was the chief of the PR department.

409
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,080
Nasu Bungu's president called to tell him

410
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,000
that he won't take us to court.

411
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
-Seriously?
-Yes.

412
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
-What a relief.
-Yes.

413
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Yeah, what a relief.
Really, what a relief.

414
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,010
Marumo's late, isn't he?

415
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:49,020
Yeah, I wonder when he's coming home.

416
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,020
Marumo?

417
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,020
-Is Takagi-san home?
-Not yet.

418
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:00,030
Oh.  Say, it's starting to rain.

419
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:02,030
Is your laundry okay?

420
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:04,030
Rain?

421
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:14,040
You're right, it's raining.

422
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,040
-We don't have any laundry outside.
-Okay.

423
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,050
Then lock the door and go to bed soon.

424
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:23,050
-Okay, good night.
-Good night.

425
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:28,050
What should I do.

426
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,000
It's coming down, isn't it?

427
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Takagi-san, thank you so much for coming today.

428
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
No, no, don't mention it.

429
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,010
If it's alright with you, shall we have dinner before we go?

430
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:53,010
My treat, as a token of my appreciation.

431
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,020
Let's go.

432
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,020
Are there any good restaurants around here?

433
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,040
What are you doing?

434
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:26,050
Shh, Mook.  Don't say anything.

435
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:28,060
Where are you going?

436
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:31,060
I'll be right back.

437
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:43,990
Kaoru.

438
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Huh? Where's Tomoki?

439
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Probably the school.

440
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Huh? Why?

441
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:03,010
Oh no.

442
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,030
[I have a very important business tomorrow.]

443
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:15,030
[I might be a little late getting home, but

444
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:18,030
you two be good and stay home.]

445
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:35,010
Sansai's up for #3 table.

446
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:37,010
-Okay.
-Katsuo no tataki'* for the counter.
(*sashimi with grilled surface)

447
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,010
Okay, one tataki.

448
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:01,030
You're gonna be alright now.

449
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:05,040
[If you water too much, the flower's gonna die, you know.]

450
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,040
[Really?]

451
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:20,050
Tomoki.
Onee-chan.

452
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,050
You shouldn't go out without telling anyone.

453
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:25,050
But the flower's going to die.

454
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:30,000
If you catch a cold,

455
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
there won't be anyone to water it.

456
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Yeah, you're right.

457
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
-Let's go home.
-Okay.

458
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:44,010
Are you alright?

459
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,020
This place is famous for their tacos.

460
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,020
I'm looking forward to it.

461
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,030
What a nice restaurant.

462
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:03,030
Let's party it up tonight.

463
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:06,030
Excuse me.

464
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:11,040
Sorry, I'll be right there,

465
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,040
so go on in first.

466
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,050
-Hello.
-Marumo?

467
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:23,050
Yeah.

468
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:25,070
Didn't I tell you I had a very important business today?

469
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:27,990
I think Tomoki caught a cold.

470
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:31,990
-A cold?
-He went out in the rain.

471
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:36,000
What was he doing?
Is he alright?

472
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I think he's alright.

473
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Tomoki, it's Marumo.

474
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Marumo, I'm alright.

475
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,010
Okay.
Stay warm and go to bed.

476
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:53,010
Okay.

477
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,010
See you later then.

478
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:17,040
Onee-chan, I feel like I'm floating.

479
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:22,040
Go to sleep, Tomoki.

480
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,040
Let's get you to bed.

481
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
What's a family?

482
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Where did that come from?

483
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,010
The kids asked me today

484
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:57,010
if Marumo's their family.

485
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:59,010
Oh, I see.

486
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,010
It caught me by surprise.

487
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:05,020
But even if you're not related by blood, you're family if you live together, right?

488
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:10,020
Well, I guess you become a family as you spend time living together.

489
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,020
Even a husband and wife aren't

490
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:15,030
related at all to start out with.

491
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:18,030
That's right, huh? Come to think of it,

492
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:21,030
Mom and Dad aren't related by blood, huh?

493
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:27,050
Family, huh?

494
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,970
Even though I failed at it.

495
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,980
You'll have plenty of opportunity in the future.

496
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,990
You're still young.

497
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,990
I've already learned my lesson.

498
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:47,990
You're too young to be saying that.

499
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:52,000
In the first place, your marriage was too short.

500
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
That's why you don't understand anything yet.

501
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Two people become true husband and wife only after overcoming difficulties together.

502
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I've had enough.

503
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:04,010
How do you know you've had enough

504
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:07,010
-after only 1 year of marriage?
-Things happened after that too.

505
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:14,020
And I thought things might work out this time.

506
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:22,030
Are you sure you weren't part of the problem too?

507
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:24,030
No I wasn't.

508
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,980
Tomoki, are you alright?

509
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,990
What should I do?

510
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:57,000
Go ahead, call him.

511
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
What?

512
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
To our hard day's work.

513
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Thank you for your hard work.

514
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

515
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:16,020
But Makimura-san, that is,

516
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:20,020
won't your boyfriend get mad if he finds out you're having dinner with me?

517
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:24,020
I don't have a boyfriend.

518
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,960
Really? Is that right?

519
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,960
-Yes.
-So you don't...

520
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,960
Excuse me!
Two tequila here please.

521
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,960
Right away please.

522
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:41,970
Excuse me.

523
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,980
This is really good.

524
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:53,990
Don't you have to answer it?

525
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:56,990
No.

526
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,990
Okay, let's drink.

527
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Excuse me.

528
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:18,010
Hello?

529
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:20,010
Tomoki's...

530
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:22,010
What's wrong?

531
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:25,030
He's having a hard time breathing. His face is all red too.

532
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:27,950
What?

533
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,960
He's breathing really hard.

534
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,960
But he said he was alright, didn't he?

535
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,960
But...

536
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:43,970
-Here you go.
-Wait a minute.

537
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:46,970
Marinated cactus, chorizo plate, and

538
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,970
chicken tacos.

539
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:52,980
Please go ahead and eat. Sorry.

540
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,980
-And?
-Fever.

541
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,980
Fever?

542
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:01,990
His forehead's really hot and he doesn't look good, Marumo.

543
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:06,990
Alright, I'll be back as soon as I can.
See you.

544
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:12,000
Was it someone from your family?

545
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Yes. No... Yes.

546
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Is someone sick?

547
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,010
But...

548
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:24,010
Please don't mind me and go.

549
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:27,010
I'll be fine.

550
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,950
Alright.

551
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:37,960
I'm sorry. Seems he suddenly got ill from a sudden illness.

552
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,960
Sorry, I'm really sorry.
Sorry.

553
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,960
Give me a break, guys.

554
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:59,980
Marumo?
Yeah. Is Tomoki alright?

555
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,980
Hey, he has a really high fever.

556
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,990
Why did he go out in the rain?

557
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,990
-Because.
-He's bound to catch a cold

558
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,990
if he goes out in this rain.

559
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,990
But he followed what you told him, Marumo.

560
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:13,990
Followed what?

561
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:18,000
You said that too much water is not good.

562
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
He went to the school to put an umbrella over the flower.

563
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
He was saying the magical spell too.

564
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,940
-Magical spell?
-The one that goes Woo~ Mambo.

565
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,940
What?

566
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:42,960
The classmates were making fun of him but

567
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,960
Tomoki said "Marumo's amazing" and

568
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,960
bragged about you to everyone.

569
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,970
What magical spell...

570
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:58,970
Tomoki, are you stupid?
For believing something like that.

571
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:02,980
Why did you believe what I said.

572
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:09,980
Tomoki, you...

573
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,990
Hey, hey. Look.

574
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,990
Doesn't he look like he's getting worse?

575
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,990
Let's take him to the hospital.

576
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:23,990
-Now?
-Yeah. Okay, Tomoki, you alright?

577
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Excuse me, can you tell me where the closest hospital is?

578
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
-Somewhere I can take him now.
-What happened?

579
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,010
He has a high fever.

580
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:37,010
What about Nagashima Clinic?
They have pediatrics there, don't they?

581
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:39,010
-Oh, yeah.
-Nagashima Clinic?

582
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:41,010
Yeah, right past the Inari shrine, to the right.

583
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:44,010
Inari shrine. Got it.

584
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,020
I'll go too.  To make sure.

585
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,020
Yeah.

586
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:55,030
Here's the Inari shrine.

587
00:38:55,030 --> 00:39:00,030
Tomoki, we're almost there. Hang on.

588
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:04,040
Takagi-san, not that way.
This way, this way.

589
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,040
-What?
-This way.

590
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,050
Hello, I have a sick child.
Please open.

591
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:17,050
Sensei, please.

592
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:19,050
Please open.
Please.

593
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:21,050
Excuse me, please.
Please open.

594
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:23,050
Excuse me, Sensei.

595
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:31,000
It was just a cold.

596
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Looks like we overreacted, huh?

597
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
We even got Aya-chan involved.

598
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Yes, but I'm relieved.

599
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:47,010
Sorry, Tomoki. You too, Kaoru.

600
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:56,020
When I heard he caught a cold, I knew I should come home,

601
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,020
but I left you two alone.

602
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:07,030
I'm no good after all.
I can't do anything.

603
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:11,030
I can't take Sasakura's place after all.

604
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,040
Marumo.

605
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:24,050
You're not no good.

606
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,990
Tomoki was saying over and over while he was sleeping.

607
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:31,990
He was saying "Marumo"

608
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:39,000
"Marumo" over and over.

609
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
So, so...

610
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,020
Marumo.

611
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:02,020
Tomoki, are you alright?

612
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:06,020
Yes.
Thanks for giving me a piggyback ride.

613
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:13,030
-Marumo's amazing just as I thought.

614
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:18,030
The flower's starting to sprout.

615
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:27,060
Wow.

616
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:38,990
You're alright now.

617
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
It's thanks to Marumo's magical spell.

618
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:58,010
I don't have mommy or daddy, but I'm happy because I have Marumo.

619
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:04,010
It's okay because Marumo's with us.

620
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,020
You guys.

621
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,040
Marumo's crying.

622
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:31,980
Sweat. This is sweat.

623
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:36,980
Ah~ it's hot in here.

624
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:46,990
-Seconds please.
-You sure eat a lot.

625
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:50,000
Marumo.

626
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I can go to school today, can't I?

627
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I took off 3 times already.

628
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I guess so, since your fever's gone too.

629
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:06,010
With that kind of an appetite,
you should be fine now.

630
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:23,020
What's today's okite?
Hm? Today it's...

631
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:33,960
Gargle, wash hands, don't catch a cold.

632
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:37,980
Prevention is the key.

633
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,980
But if you don't feel well, you have to tell me right away, okay?

634
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,980
Got it.

635
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:45,980
It's a superstition when they say fools don't catch colds.

636
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:48,990
-What does that mean?
-Huh? Never mind.

637
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:51,990
Okay, we're all gonna make a promise.

638
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:53,990
Come.

639
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Am I catching a cold?

640
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:10,010
-Marumo.
-Marumo.

641
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:12,010
Marumo.

642
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:15,010
Marumo?
Marumo.

643
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:17,020
Marumo?
Are you alright?

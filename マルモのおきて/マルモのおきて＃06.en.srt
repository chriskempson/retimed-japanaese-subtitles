1
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,830
Coach Marumo.
We're ready.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,830
Okay. Keep your eyes open and watch the ball.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,840
First up is Kaoru. Let's go.

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,840
What was that?
We're not playing volleyball, you know.

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,850
However, that was nice play that you let it drop in front of you.

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,850
Thank you.

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,850
Oh, there's Hayato-kun.

8
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,850
Is he your classmate?

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,860
-He's alone again.
-What do you mean again?

10
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,860
Hayato-kun's daddy and mommy are busy

11
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,860
so he's always playing by himself.

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,860
Then go see if he wants to join us, Kaoru.

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,870
-Is it okay?
-Two or three, same difference.

14
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:45,870
-I'll coach you all.
-Yes, Coach.

15
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,870
Hayato-kun.

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,880
Huh? Hayato-kun?

17
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,830
Marumo, we're gonna be late if we don't get going.

18
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,830
I know. We're almost done, so just hang in there.

19
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,830
Tomoki, finish eating now.
I tell you, we're going to be late.

20
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,840
-Hey, don't move.
-I'm done eating.

21
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,840
Okay, done.

22
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:34,850
-They're uneven.
-Are they?

23
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:40,860
Look, if you look at it like this, it's even. Right?

24
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,860
-Yeah.
-Yeah, thanks.

25
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,870
We're going.
-Okay, see you later.

26
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,870
See you later.

27
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,870
I tell you, they're uneven.

28
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,870
It's the thought that counts.

29
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,820
Safe.

30
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,820
Oh, there's Hayato-kun.

31
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,820
Hayato-kun, why did you leave yesterday?

32
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,830
Coach Marumo was gonna teach us catch.

33
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,830
You're always alone, aren't you?
Come practice with us.

34
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,830
What?

35
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,840
Hayato, you're gonna play catch with a girl?

36
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,840
No, I'm not.

37
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
-Why?
-Because.

38
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,840
Playing catch is fun.

39
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,850
Be quiet, Sasa Buta*.
(*Buta = pig)

40
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:36,850
-You're Sasakura so you're Sasa Buta.
-I'm not a pig.

41
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:42,860
Hayato-kun, her name's Sasakura Kaoru, not Sasa Buta.

42
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,860
Sasa Buta Gaoru.
(Ga oru - literally, is here, ie., Sasa Buta is here)

43
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,860
He said Sasa Buta is here.

44
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,870
Sasa Buta Gaoru.

45
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,870
-But I'm not a pig.
-Sasa Buta Gaoru.

46
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,870
Hey, don't run around in the classroom.

47
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,890
-You could get hurt.
-But Hayato-kun...

48
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,810
No excuses.

49
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,810
Sasakura-san, hurry up and sit down.

50
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,820
-Takagi-san?
-What? Oh.

51
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,830
-Hello.
-Makimura-san, hello.

52
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,830
Thank you for helping me out the other day.

53
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,830
Are you alright now?

54
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:28,830
Yes. I'm sorry for asking you for such a strange favor.

55
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,840
To ask you to pretend to be my fiancee

56
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,840
was such a impertinent, no, bold, request.

57
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,840
Although I was a little nervous since I've never acted before.

58
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,840
I'm very disappointed and regret that I didn't get to see it with my own eyes.

59
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,850
-Makimura-san.
-Yes.

60
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:54,860
Um...If it's okay with you,
I'd like to thank you.

61
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:59,870
Um...
Would you like to go to dinner sometime?

62
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,870
It's alright if you don't want to.
It's perfectly alright if you don't want to.

63
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,810
-I would love to.
-Really?

64
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:16,820
But don't leave me behind this time, okay?

65
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,820
Huh?
Did that ever happen?

66
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,820
-It did, didn't it?
-It did... I'm sorry.

67
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,830
That won't happen again.
Never, never again.

68
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,830
Sorry.

69
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:39,840
Hey, do you guys remember Makimura-san?

70
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,840
Oh, the onee-san who came here when Marumo had the mumps?

71
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,850
-Tomoki, you're right.
-Yes!

72
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:51,850
I have a dinner engagement with Makimura-san.

73
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,850
-What's dinner engagement?
-That's, you know, dinner?

74
00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:00,880
To put it simply,
it's a d-date.

75
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,800
-Date?
-Is that an overstatement?

76
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,800
Maybe a date is an overstatement?

77
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,800
-Too overjoyed.
-Who, me?

78
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,810
What's that mood there.
Is something wrong, Kaoru-chan?

79
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,810
Um...
Today, Hayato-kun...

80
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,810
It's nothing. It's nothing.

81
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,820
What, say what's on your mind.

82
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,820
Really, it's nothing.

83
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,820
Hey, we have an okite to say what's on our mind.

84
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,830
Hayato-kun called me Sasa Buta.

85
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,830
You got teased?

86
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,840
He changed Sasakura to Sasa Buta.

87
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,840
He said Sasa Buta Gaoru.

88
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,840
Isn't he horrible?

89
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,840
That's pretty good for a first grader.
Huh?

90
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,850
-It's not funny.
-Listen, Kaoru.

91
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,850
It's a habit for the boys to tease the girls.

92
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,850
When boys see cute girls, they just get the urge to tease them.

93
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,790
-That's disgusting.
-Hey, that's not disgusting,

94
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:06,790
that's just a practical joke.
That's togetherness. Okay?

95
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,800
You have to let it go.
Just ignore it.

96
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,800
Takagi-san, you just don't understand.

97
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,800
Kaoru-chan will be even more hurt if you say it like that.

98
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,810
She was just teased, you know.  If she gets upset every time she's teased...

99
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,810
It's a very serious problem for girls.

100
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,810
And there you go, saying things like let it go and ignore it,

101
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,820
the very things you shouldn't be saying.

102
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,820
Aya-san's right.
You don't understand at all.

103
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,820
Why are you here?

104
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,820
Can't you see?
I'm drinking shochu.

105
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,830
He's been coming quite often recently.

106
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,830
He's a regular customer. Right?

107
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,830
He lives in the complete opposite direction, you know. It's really far from here.

108
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,830
I don't think distance has anything to do with it.

109
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,840
But leaving that aside, Takagi-san, you don't know women at all.

110
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,840
I bet you've been insensitive since you were a kid.

111
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,840
How am I supposed to know girls' feelings.
I'm a boy.

112
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,860
Woah. He's assuming a defiant attitude.

113
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,780
I'm not being defiant.
It's the truth, isn't it?

114
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,780
Enough about this already.

115
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,790
Just now, you were thinking this is a pain, didn't you?

116
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,790
That's not a good attitude, you know.

117
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,790
Pops, give me a beer.

118
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:16,800
Ignoring. Ignoring is the worst thing to do. That's definitely the worst.

119
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,800
Takagi-san, you're not gonna be able to marry if you don't change your ways.

120
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,800
Even if by chance you find a wife,
she's going to leave you.

121
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
If by chance?

122
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,810
Aren't all men like that?

123
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,810
Generally speaking,

124
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,810
if you don't have an open mind to accept that kind of things,

125
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,810
-you just might fail.
-Fail...what?

126
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,820
What are you insinuating?

127
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,820
-Nothing.
-Insinuating? Insinuating?

128
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
Dad, are you thinking that I was at fault?

129
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,820
Well, I wasn't.
He's the one

130
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,820
-who was sneaking around with a woman.
-He? Who's he?

131
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,830
Just because he fooled around once,

132
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,830
-isn't it a bit harsh to unilaterally cut off all ties?
-Cut off what ties?

133
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,830
Can you be quiet for a while, please?

134
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,830
Once.
-What do you mean once?

135
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:58,840
All I'm saying is you should forgive him for that one time.

136
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,770
I can't believe what you just said.

137
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,780
Takagi-san, don't turn out to be like him.

138
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,780
You have to listen to what Kaoru-chan has to say.

139
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,780
Yes.

140
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,790
-Rinka-chan.
-Yes?

141
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,800
Were you ever teased by boys when you were little?

142
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,800
Of course I was.

143
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
All the girls were, weren't they?

144
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,800
Would that be considered an unpleasant experience?

145
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,800
That goes without saying.
What?

146
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,810
Didn't you even know that, Takagi-kun?

147
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,810
Takagi-san's just now learning now that he's almost 40.

148
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,810
How do I explain it.

149
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,820
It felt like I was stepped on all over by someone's shoes.

150
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,820
-Muddy shoes at that too.
-It's that bad?

151
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,820
Takagi-kun was one of the boys who teased, huh?

152
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,830
Yes. I did tease all the girls I liked, so?

153
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,830
Why do you tease them if you like them?

154
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,830
Don't you tease them because you like them?

155
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,830
What's that supposed to mean.

156
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,770
-Takagi-kun.
-Yes.

157
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,770
-Can I see you for a minute?
-Yes.

158
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,770
I'm going to visit a regular customer tomorrow. Let's go together.

159
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,780
-It will be a good learning experience for you.
-A regular customer?

160
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,780
Yes. Last month's reports.
Go over them, okay?

161
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,780
Yes.

162
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:22,790
What's a regular customer?
Is it a customer who complains regularly?

163
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,790
I've never met this person, but

164
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,790
Samejima-san goes for a visit once in a while by himself.

165
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,800
Personally?

166
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,800
Maybe he's planning to

167
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,800
have Takagi-san take over that regular customer?

168
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,800
Does that mean I'm going to be dealing with him instead?

169
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
By telling you to go over the reports

170
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,810
isn't he telling you to use discretion in your interaction?

171
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,810
-That's scary.
-But why me?

172
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,820
Athlete Kaoru, here it comes.

173
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,820
Bring it on.

174
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:57,820
I can't catch it if you don't throw it here.

175
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,830
You're hopeless.

176
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:03,830
Give it back. We're practicing on our own.
Coach Marumo told us to.

177
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:07,830
He's just telling you to practice on your own because he got tired of playing with you.

178
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,840
Marumo isn't your real dad, is he?

179
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,840
Marumo is Marumo.

180
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,840
If he's not your dad, why are you living with him?

181
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,840
That's because we're family.

182
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,850
That's weird that he's family even though he's not your dad.

183
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,850
He'll get tired of you right away and abandon you.

184
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,850
Marumo won't do that.

185
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:29,860
Pretty soon he's gonna start saying he's too busy at work

186
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,860
and make the kids eat and go to sleep by themselves.

187
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,860
He's not going to be playing catch with you either.

188
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,860
The ball.

189
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,860
Marumo's gonna abandon you anyway.
Kaoru's gonna be abandoned by Marumo.

190
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,800
Okay, done. Sit down, guys.

191
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,810
Itadakima~su.

192
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,820
Aren't you eating, Marumo?

193
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,820
Huh?
I don't have time to think about eating right now.

194
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,820
If I let my guard down,
I might be trouble tomorrow.

195
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,830
Marumo, hang in there.

196
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:57,830
You guys sure have it easy.

197
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,840
I want to clean up soon so

198
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,840
hurry up and eat.

199
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,840
I don't feel like eating.

200
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,850
I took time out of my busy schedule to make it, so eat up.

201
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:16,850
If you're disobedient, I'm gonna kick you out.
I'm gonna throw you out with oversize trash.

202
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,810
Tomoki.

203
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,810
What?

204
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,810
Do you enjoy being with Marumo?

205
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:47,820
-A lot.
-Me too.

206
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:53,820
But I wonder if Marumo enjoys being with us.

207
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,820
We're always happy but

208
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,830
maybe Marumo doesn't like making meals,

209
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:03,830
and cleaning, and working until late at night.

210
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,830
I don't know.

211
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,850
Okay.

212
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,810
What happened?

213
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,820
Hey, what are you doing?

214
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,820
Something smells.

215
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,820
What?

216
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:13,840
Hey, that too?

217
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,780
I was trying to make breakfast for Marumo.

218
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,780
So how did it turn out like this?

219
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,790
Don't make more work for me.
Really.

220
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,790
What are we going to do with this?

221
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,800
Onee-chan, first period is language.

222
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,800
-Oh, okay.
-Good morning, Sasa Buta.

223
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,810
Hayato-kun, shh~.

224
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,810
Onee-chan's down because she messed up breakfast.

225
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:02,820
Everything turned out black.
Marumo's papers got all black too.

226
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,820
Tomoki.

227
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,820
Did you interfere with his work?

228
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,830
That's bad.
Marumo's gonna abandon you.

229
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,830
Oh-oh. You're gonna get abandoned.

230
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,830
-Marumo and Sasa Buta are gonna be separated.
-Be quiet.

231
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,830
Sasa Buta and Marumo are gonna be separated.

232
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,850
We're not gonna be separated...

233
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,770
Ouch.

234
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,770
Hayato-kun, are you alright?

235
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,790
Tea alright?

236
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:46,790
Tea's fine.
Make it cold.

237
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,800
You nervous?

238
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,810
But who is that person?

239
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,810
-Date-chan.
-Date-chan?

240
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,810
He's a former complainant.

241
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,810
Former meaning he's not now?

242
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:08,820
Shall we say he's now an outside consultant?

243
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,820
Actually, I'm just consulting him on my own so

244
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,820
maybe he's my private outside consultant.

245
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,830
Anyway, he's done a lot for me.

246
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:25,770
Considering that, you don't even bring gifts when you visit, do you.

247
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:29,770
A long time ago, I took Date-chan's complaint.

248
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:33,780
Talk about persistent.

249
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:37,780
That's because of the flimsy pencils you guys were making.

250
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,780
See what I mean?

251
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:43,790
Everyone got so scared, no one wanted to deal with him.

252
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:47,790
Thanks to me, though, you came up with a sturdy pencil with unbreakable lead, right?

253
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,790
-Yes, yes.
-What happened?

254
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,800
He was so persistent that I talked it over with the top

255
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,800
and based on Date-chan's complaint, we made a slight improvement to the product.

256
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,810
Although it took a long time.

257
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:06,810
-It was from that time, huh?
-Yeah.

258
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,810
That I sometimes discuss the complaints we get

259
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,810
at Customer Services with Date-chan.

260
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,820
You know, for every complaint we get,

261
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,820
our interpretation and theirs are different, right?

262
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:22,840
Ah, so that's what you meant when you told me to review the reports.

263
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,760
By the way, what happened to the strawberry glue?

264
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,760
The uproar's somewhat under control, but

265
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,770
-looks like the production will be decreased.
-The feeling is that

266
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,770
strawberry glue caused too much commotion.

267
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:39,770
I bought it for my grandkid too, but

268
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,780
he found it so amusing, he pasted things like

269
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,780
flyers and receipts all over the place.

270
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,780
-Everything got sticky.
-We're very sorry for the inconvenience.

271
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,780
No, that's okay.

272
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,790
There aren't too many office supplies that make you want to use it

273
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,800
-for no apparent reason.
-Well, I suppose.

274
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,800
So the production will be decreased, huh?

275
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Seems like a waste to let an opportunity to please the customers slip away

276
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,800
because of the seller's circumstances.

277
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,810
Doesn't what he say make sense?

278
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,810
Excuse me.

279
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:17,810
It comes down to the fact that our company doesn't handle

280
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:20,810
-fancy goods like that very well.
-So that's what it's about, huh?

281
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,760
-Marumo?
-Kaoru.

282
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,760
Ta-Takagi-san.
-Why are you here?

283
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,770
Hey. Huh? Where did you get hurt?
Are you alright?

284
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,770
Um..that's not it, Takagi-san.

285
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,770
Taniguchi-san's the one who got injured, and

286
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:46,780
Sasakura-san is the one who caused the injury.

287
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,780
What?

288
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,790
The injury's just a light bruise.

289
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,790
We had a doctor take a look just to be sure,

290
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,790
but the injury's so minor, you didn't need to come...

291
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:07,800
Kaoru, did you apologize properly?

292
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,800
-Go apologize.
-But I didn't do anything wrong.

293
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,800
What do you mean you didn't do anything wrong when you made him get hurt.

294
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,810
Go on, apologize.

295
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,810
Now, now Takagi-san.

296
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:22,830
It doesn't sound like Sasakura-san was totally in the wrong

297
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,750
since they were both joking around.

298
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,750
I'm very sorry.

299
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,760
My apology won't do, will it?

300
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,760
It doesn't matter.

301
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,770
What about Hayato-kun's parents?

302
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:45,770
Due to circumstances at work, they said they couldn't come today.

303
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,770
Both of them?

304
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,770
Yes. They must be busy.

305
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:58,780
Kaoru, why didn't you apologize?

306
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,780
I didn't do anything wrong.

307
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,780
You still saying that?

308
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:05,790
I know because I apologize every day.

309
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,790
"I'm sorry" opens up the other person's heart.

310
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,790
But I don't want to apologize.

311
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,800
When you apologize first,

312
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,800
lot of times that can bring you closer.

313
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,800
I don't care if I'm not close to him.

314
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,740
I give up then.
I'm disappointed in you.

315
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:45,820
-How's Kaoru?
-She went to sleep without even eating.

316
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,820
You say she caused the injury, but wasn't it

317
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,820
-like it just happened by chance?
-Well, yes.

318
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,830
But she won't apologize.

319
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,830
I don't know if she's stubborn or insolent or what.

320
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,830
But I'm surprised. I thought she'd be a bit more mature.

321
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,840
She has the nerve to sulk and be miffed.

322
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,840
Really makes me mad.

323
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,850
Why are you laughing?

324
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,850
Being able to sulk and get mad

325
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:20,850
means that ...you know.
That you're a family.

326
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,850
It's proof that

327
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,860
you're not holding anything back from each other.

328
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:30,860
That's a good thing.
To be able to say what you want without holding anything back.

329
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:35,870
That's right. Aya-chan and you're like that too.

330
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,870
-Us?
-You were fighting the other day too.

331
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:41,810
Yeah...I guess.

332
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,810
You know, all fathers go through

333
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:47,810
a period of time when their daughters won't talk to them.

334
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:51,820
During that period, my wife died,

335
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,820
and things just got worse.

336
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:01,830
It's only just recently.
That we got comfortable enough to fight.

337
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,840
-I'm done eating.
-Okay.

338
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:25,850
Kaoru, you apologize to Hayato-kun today.

339
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:28,850
No. I'm not going to school.

340
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:31,860
It's best if you apologize and you two become close.

341
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,860
I don't care if we don't get close.

342
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:37,860
Weren't you saying that someone who teases a friend is disgusting?

343
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,800
Then isn't someone who causes a friend to get hurt

344
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,800
and refuse to apologize disgusting? That's the worst, isn't it?

345
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,800
I'm not the worst.

346
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,810
"Oh-oh, you're gonna get abandoned."

347
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:51,810
"Marumo and Sasa Buta are gonna get separated."

348
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:56,810
I don't like people who won't accept advice.

349
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:03,820
But Hayato-ku said we...That Marumo would...

350
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,830
What did I do?
Are you putting the blame on me?

351
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,830
But...

352
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:13,830
Forget it.
Just be like that, you spoiled baby.

353
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,830
Tomoki, we're going.

354
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:20,840
I hate you, Marumo!
I don't even want to see your face!

355
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,840
Oh, I see. I get it.
Let's go.

356
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,860
You're by yourself?

357
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,860
Onee-chan didn't want to come to school.

358
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
It's because Hayato-kun gives her a hard time.

359
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,800
You're the worst.

360
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,820
Kaoru-chan, I brought you lunch.

361
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,850
Aya-chan.

362
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,850
Hm? What?

363
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:40,790
Marumo and us are family, aren't we?

364
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:45,790
Yes, didn't we talk about this before?
You're living together so you're family.

365
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:49,790
I wonder if we can keep on being together.

366
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,800
If we're separated, is that the end of our family?

367
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:57,800
What? What are you saying all of a sudden?

368
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
Don't tell Marumo, okay?

369
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,810
Okay.

370
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:07,810
Hayato-kun said we're going to get separated sooner or later.

371
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:09,810
He said that?

372
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:12,820
Aya-chan, Marumo isn't our daddy.

373
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:16,820
So if we're separated, is that the end of our family?

374
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:23,820
-Good night.
-Good night.

375
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:30,840
[I hate you, Marumo!
I don't even want to see your face!]

376
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:35,840
[Oh, I see. I get it.]

377
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,840
Takagi-kun, get that report done today please.

378
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,840
Yes.

379
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,780
Takagi-kun?

380
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,790
Shiozawa-san, you have a child, don't you?

381
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:56,790
-I do. He's in high school.
-High school, huh?

382
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,800
When your child was in grade school,

383
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,800
did he ever have problems at school and refuse to go?

384
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,800
Why are you asking about that out of the blue?

385
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,800
No, I just wondered.

386
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,810
Mine isn't very bright,

387
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:10,810
so he used to say he wasn't going to school because he didn't want to study.

388
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,810
What did you do at times like that?

389
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,810
I'd buy him a new notebook.
Nice and blank.

390
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,820
-Notebook?
-Yes.

391
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,820
Boys are pretty simple-minded, aren't they?

392
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,820
He must have felt smarter or something just because he got a brand new notebook.

393
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,820
It's like he got motivated suddenly
and wanted to go to school.

394
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,830
Isn't he stupid?

395
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:33,830
I see.  He is simple-minded.

396
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,830
Of course, that's what makes him so endearing too.

397
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:39,850
I understand.

398
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:44,780
Takagi-kun, you get motivated too and finish that up, okay?

399
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,780
I'm leaving first then.

400
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,780
Good night.

401
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:56,790
What a nice story.

402
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:59,790
-What?
-What Shiozawa-san was talking about right now.

403
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:04,790
It means that stationery isn't just supplies.

404
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:11,800
It would be nice if there were stationery that's not just practical

405
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,810
but something exciting that would encourage children, don't you think?

406
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:19,810
I'll leave first then.

407
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,810
Good night.

408
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,820
Encourage...

409
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,780
Found them.

410
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,820
-Onee-chan, Marumo's late, isn't he?
-Is he working overtime?

411
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:20,830
Marumo doesn't have overtime.
He said so before.

412
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:25,830
He should have been home long time ago.
I wonder what happened.

413
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,860
-Hello?
-This is Aya.

414
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,870
Oh, thank you for bringing Kaoru's lunch.

415
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,870
I'll make sure she goes to school tomorrow.

416
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:04,810
About that...

417
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:07,810
-Yes?
-She told me not to tell you, so

418
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:10,810
I wasn't sure whether I should.

419
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,810
What is it?

420
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,820
The reason Kaoru-chan didn't want to go to school

421
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:20,820
wasn't just because she was being teased by a boy.

422
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,820
-What?
-She was told that

423
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,830
since you're not the real dad, you won't be together for long, 

424
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,830
and that's what upset her.

425
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:34,830
Listen to what Kaoru-chan has to say when you get home, okay?

426
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,840
Good bye then.

427
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,840
Yes.

428
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:51,850
[It's a habit for the boys to tease the girls.]

429
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:55,860
[You have to let it go.
Just ignore it.]

430
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:05,800
[But Hayato-ku said we...That Marumo would...]

431
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:10,800
[What did I do?
Are you putting the blame on me?]

432
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:15,810
[I hate you, Marumo!
I don't even want to see your face!]

433
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:01,860
Looks just like Mook.

434
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,860
Shaggy hair.

435
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,800
Onee-chan, what's wrong?

436
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,830
Onee-chan.

437
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,830
Tomoki.

438
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,830
What?

439
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,830
Marumo's late, huh?

440
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,840
What should we do if Marumo doesn't come home anymore?

441
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,850
[Don't make more work for me.
What are you doing?]

442
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,850
[What do you mean you didn't do anything wrong when you made him get hurt.]《

443
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,850
[I'm really sorry.]

444
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:05,790
[I hate you, Marumo!
I don't even want to see your face!]

445
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:10,790
[Oh, I see. I get it.]

446
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:13,790
I made trouble for Marumo at home and at school too.

447
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,800
I even got into a fight so

448
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,800
Marumo might not come home because of me.

449
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,800
-What?
-If he doesn't come home

450
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,800
and we get separated,

451
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,810
that's the end of our family.
Because we're different.

452
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,810
No, I don't want that to happen.

453
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:32,810
I won't be able to eat the food Marumo makes.

454
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,820
He won't be sprinkling the goma shio boss, and

455
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,820
he won't be playing catch with us.

456
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,820
We'll never get better.

457
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:44,830
I want to be with Marumo.

458
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:47,830
I'm sorry, Tomoki.

459
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,830
Onee-chan.

460
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:57,840
Kaoru, do you like Marumo?

461
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,840
-A lot.
-Then all you have to do is apologize.

462
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:11,790
I want to apologize to Marumo.
Let's go, Tomoki.

463
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,800
Which way?

464
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,800
When he doesn't come home, does he sleep at the office?

465
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,800
Then let's go to his office.

466
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,800
Okay, the station's that way.

467
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,810
Which ticket do we buy?

468
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,810
Let's go over there.

469
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,820
What are those guys doing?

470
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,820
There's a lot of stations.

471
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,820
Where's Akebono Office Supplies?

472
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,830
I don't know.

473
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:02,830
We should have learned how to ride trains, huh?

474
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:08,840
We can't go to see Marumo by ourselves, can we?

475
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,840
Tomoki, when Marumo comes home,

476
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,840
let's help him out a lot, okay?

477
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:19,850
Okay. We can't cook, but we can clean and do the laundry.

478
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:23,850
Yeah. And we can't be fussy about our food.

479
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:26,850
Okay. I'll eat all my carrots too.

480
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:30,850
I hope Marumo comes home.

481
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,800
I'll have to apologize when I see Marumo.

482
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:42,800
Like how Marumo did with Hayato-kun.
Bow properly like this.

483
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:50,810
Marumo, I'm sorry for burning the breakfast.

484
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:56,820
Marumo, I'm sorry for not apologizing to Hayato-kun.

485
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:01,820
Marumo, I'm sorry for saying that I hate you.

486
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,830
And, and...

487
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:07,830
Kaoru, Tomoki.

488
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:15,840
Where are you guys going?

489
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,840
Marumo.

490
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,840
Sorry.

491
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,850
Marumo.

492
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:30,850
Hey, hey, why are you crying?

493
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:34,850
We were afraid Marumo wasn't coming home.

494
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:38,790
Of course I'm coming home.

495
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:41,800
I don't have any place else to go home to.

496
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,800
You guys too.

497
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,800
The 2nd floor of Kujira is all we have.

498
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:52,800
But Marumo, you don't like Kaoru, right?

499
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:00,810
Let's see. There could be times

500
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:02,820
that I may think I don't like you.

501
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,820
That's what I thought.

502
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,820
If you don't like me, we can't live together, right?

503
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,820
We'll be separated.

504
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,820
What? What are you saying.

505
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:14,830
Of course we'll still be together even if we don't like each other at times.

506
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:18,830
-Why?
-Because we're family.

507
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:23,840
Stay together if you like each other and go our separate ways if you don't.

508
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,840
A family isn't something that should be taken lightly like that.

509
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,840
To stay together whether you like it or not, that's what family's all about.

510
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:36,780
Even when Kaoru grows up and says things like "Marumo, you smell,"

511
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,790
I won't go away,
and when Tomoki grows up

512
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:41,790
and says things like "Marumo, you're super annoying," you can forget about it.

513
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:44,790
Because we're family.

514
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,790
What was that.

515
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:50,800
Anyway, we'll always be together.

516
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,800
I'm glad.

517
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,800
Okay, let's go home then.

518
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:07,810
Look. I was late because I was making these.

519
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,810
Open it and see.

520
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,820
Did you make these, Marumo?

521
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:20,830
There were a lot of these unsold erasers at the office. My failed idea.

522
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:25,830
I used those and tried making some hand-made stamps.

523
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:28,840
-I made them for you.
-Thank you.

524
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,840
Try it.

525
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:47,790
Cute.

526
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:50,790
Is this Mook? He's big.

527
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:57,800
There's Marumo and Onee-chan, and
who's this?

528
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,800
-That's you.
-He looks like me.

529
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,810
It's a family stamp.
See, we're all together.

530
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:12,810
Then here's today's okite.

531
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:27,830
Whether you like it or not, we're family.

532
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:37,770
Alright.

533
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,780
Okay, let's go to sleep now.

534
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,780
Good night.

535
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,790
I want to sleep with Marumo.

536
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,790
-Me too.
-Wait, wait, the three of us

537
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:58,790
can't fit in here.
Hey, wait.

538
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:01,800
Hey, no, no, you're falling off.
Wait...

539
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,800
We'll be okay.

540
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:08,800
No, no, no, hey.
It's too cramped.

541
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,800
-It's cramped.
-No it's not.

542
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,810
-It's hot.
-No it's not.

543
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,810
Excuse me.

544
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:18,810
Looks like you're having fun, so let me join in too.

545
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:20,810
Wait, wait.
No, no more.

546
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,820
No, no, no, no.

547
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,820
That tickles. That tickles.

548
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:30,820
Mook, Moo...
Get away from there, Mook.

549
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,840
Don't thrash around in there, Mook.

550
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,760
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Kaoru-chan.

551
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,760
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

552
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:48,770
Hayato-kun, I'm sorry for making you get hurt.

553
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,780
Marumo taught me how to apologize

554
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,780
so I'm just practicing.

555
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:05,790
Sasakura-san, I'm sorry for teasing you.

556
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:10,790
This is just practice too.

557
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,800
You don't have a choice, Hayato-kun,

558
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,800
since you like Onee-chan, right?

559
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,810
What? What are you saying?

560
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,810
Marumo told us that

561
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:24,810
boys tease girls they like.

562
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:29,820
So that must mean Hayato-kun likes Onee-chan.

563
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,820
I don't like her.

564
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:34,750
Oh, Hayato-kun, you must like her.

565
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:37,760
-He's turning red.
-He is.

566
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,760
Look, he's turning red, red, red.

567
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,770
Marumo made it for us.
Family stamp.

568
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:49,770
-What's that.
-That's so cute.

569
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:53,770
Isn't it? Isn't it?

570
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:55,780
Then one more.

571
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,780
Quit it.

572
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,780
Wait.

573
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:04,780
Hey, don't run around in the classroom.

574
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,780
"I'm sorry"

575
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:13,790
Let's get begin the class.
Everyone get back to your desk.

576
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:37,750
What's that?

577
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:40,750
Huh? What? What?

578
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:46,760
Remember that first complaint I took?

579
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,760
That woman who used the cap as a ear cleaner and bled.

580
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,760
Oh, yeah, I remember.

581
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,770
I was wondering

582
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:57,770
if that woman would be agreeable if there was a pen like this.

583
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:59,770
-What?
-No, it was just an absurd idea...

584
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:01,770
No, no.

585
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,780
That's interesting.

586
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:15,790
Write it up in a proposal and submit it to me.

587
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:19,790
I'll be looking forward to it.

588
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,800
Coach Marumo. Please train us.

589
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,800
Okay, here it goes.

590
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,740
What was that.

591
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:41,750
However, I'll give you credit for going all out to go after the ball.

592
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:44,750
Thank you, Coach Marumo.

593
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:46,750
Here we go.

594
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:49,750
Oh, there's Hayato-kun.

595
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:00,770
Okay, next up is Athlete Hayato.
Let's go for it.

596
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:07,770
-You're hopeless. -How do you expect to catch a ball just standing there.

597
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:09,780
-Come here, we're gonna practice.
-Come on.

598
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:12,780
Come on, Hayato-kun.

599
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,780
Coach Marumo, please train us.

600
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:17,780
Okay then, next is fly ball.

601
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:24,790
Who's gonna get that.
Call for it. Go, Kaoru.

602
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,810
-Mamoru-kun, long time no see.
-What happened, Sasakura-san?

603
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:41,810
-Sorry for just showing up.

604
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:48,820
Truth of the matter is, the twins' mother contacted me.

605
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,820
Ayumi-san did?

606
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:53,820
She found out somehow that

607
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:56,820
Junichirou passed away.

608
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:03,830
And she's saying she wants to see the twins.

609
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:05,830
I see.

610
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:07,830
I didn't know what to say.

611
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:14,840
Of course, I told her she couldn't, but I thought I'd at least let you know.

612
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:19,840
I see. I understand.

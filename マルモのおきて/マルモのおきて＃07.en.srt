1
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,140
Let's go.

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,140
One more time.

3
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,150
-Where are they?
-There's the culprit.

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,150
Suspicious individual found.

5
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:24,150
-You, the guy with bangs, don't move.
-What?

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,160
You monster!

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,160
What? What, what, what~.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,160
Marumo~.

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,160
You again?

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,170
I don't understand why I'm sitting here.

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,170
It's because of this.

12
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,170
He's the suspect for attempted child kidnapping.

13
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,170
Look, exactly the same.

14
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,180
-Marumo?
-It's Marumo.

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,180
-It looks like you.
-Marumo.

16
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,180
Someone reported seeing a man who looked like him.

17
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,180
You've got to be kidding me.

18
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,190
How can a kidnapper be leisurely reading manga

19
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,190
-in broad daylight.
-Do you have any ID?

20
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,190
Give me a break.

21
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:08,130
Here's my driver's license and
here's the kids' insurance card.

22
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,140
Oh, the kids' birthday's coming up soon.

23
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,140
-When's their birthday?
-Huh?

24
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,140
What do you mean "Huh?"
Don't you know their birthday?

25
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,140
Of course I do.

26
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,150
-It's soon, right?
-It's May 29th.

27
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,150
-This Sunday.
-It's this Sunday.

28
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,150
Come on now. Children's birthdays are...

29
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,150
No need to worry.

30
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,160
I've already made plans to buy this huge cake

31
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,160
and have this awesome birthday party.

32
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,160
-Really?
-Sure, leave it to me.

33
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,160
Yay~.
Yay, yay, cake, cake.

34
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:45,170
So, this Sunday's your birthday, huh?

35
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,170
Is there anything you want?

36
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,170
There is but...

37
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,180
-What is it, say it.
-You see,

38
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,180
we already asked Santa so it's okay.

39
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,180
Santa's for Christmas.
He only comes in December.

40
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,180
What? What should we do?

41
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,120
-We made a mistake.
-That's why tell me.

42
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,120
But Daddy said we're not supposed to tell anyone else.

43
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,120
It has to be a secret between Santa and us.

44
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,130
-What?
-So we can't even tell Marumo.

45
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,130
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

46
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,130
-That Sasakura.
-Sorry.

47
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,130
Sorry.
Sorry, sorry

48
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,140
Sorry, sorry.

49
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,140
Mook, come here, come here.

50
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,140
Sit, sit.

51
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:31,150
Hey, Mook.
Do you know what those kids want?

52
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,150
Why don't you find it out for me, Mook?

53
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,150
Huh? Huh? Okay

54
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,160
Let's figure out what they want and surprise them. Okay?

55
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,160
Yes. Let's do it!

56
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,170
What's wrong?
You have this serious look on your face.

57
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:51,170
I was just wondering

58
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,170
what kind of presents first graders would want.

59
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,170
-But why do you want to know?
-Lolita complex?

60
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:00,180
No, it's for my friend's kids.
I'm wondering what

61
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,110
I should give for a birthday present.

62
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,120
They can never have enough clothes.

63
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,120
Oh, clothes.

64
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,120
-I guess you wouldn't know the size.
-That's alright.

65
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,120
-We take baths together.
-Baths?

66
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,130
-Together?
-No, um...no...

67
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,130
-It's not what you think.
-Oh, isn't it something like

68
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,130
you ran into them at the public bath?

69
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,130
Yes, that's it.
Ran into them, that's it.

70
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,130
And it's not just the girl.

71
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,140
There's a boy too.
They're twins.

72
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,140
Why don't you just ask them?

73
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,140
What they want.

74
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,140
I did, but they said they told Santa

75
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,150
so they can't tell me.

76
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,150
-Santa, huh?
-I don't know what to do.

77
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,150
Come to think of it,
I used to ask Santa too.

78
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,150
-By writing a letter to him.
-What do you do with the letter?

79
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,160
I put it away in a safe place at home.

80
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,160
Letter, huh?

81
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,160
First is rock.
Rock paper scissors.

82
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,170
Look that way.

83
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,170
Oh, I lost.

84
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,170
Yay!

85
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,110
Hey, let me play too.

86
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,110
Can you play this, Mook?

87
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,110
Yeah.
If I win, tell me what you want for your present.

88
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,110
Hm~ I guess it's okay, huh?

89
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,120
-Okay.
-Let's play then.

90
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,120
Okay, start.
First is rock,

91
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,120
Rock paper scissors.

92
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,130
That's rock, isn't it?

93
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,130
Then I win.

94
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,130
Look that way.

95
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,140
Yay!

96
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,140
Too bad, Mook.
We can't tell you about our present.

97
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,140
We can't tell you.

98
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,140
-I'm home.
-Hi.

99
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,150
Marumo, Mook lost to Tomoki in

100
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,150
-"look that way".
-What?

101
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,150
Mission failed.

102
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,150
Look, you can only do rock.

103
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,160
Where could it be.
Santa. Santa.

104
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,160
Where's the letter to Santa?

105
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,180
I don't see it.

106
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,100
It has to be around here somewhere, Mook.

107
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,100
You look too.

108
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:21,120
2004. That's pretty recent.

109
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,120
Look Mook, Kaoru and Tomoki.
They're so tiny and cute.

110
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,130
They're going to be 7 years old.

111
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:34,130
They've only been living for 6 years.

112
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,130
Isn't that amazing?

113
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,140
I just don't know what kind of things they'd want.

114
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,140
-Takagi-kun.
-Yes.

115
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:51,140
-What happened to that proposal?
-Oh, it's ready.

116
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:56,150
-It's interesting.
-What proposal?

117
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,160
It's a proposal for a new product.

118
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,160
What is it?

119
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,090
It's a multi-purpose pen for those obsessed with writing.

120
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,100
It's a ball point pen, mechanical pencil,

121
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,100
and highlighter, but the finishing touch is this.

122
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,100
-It has an ear cleaner too.
-Ear cleaner?

123
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,100
Oh, that complaint we got.

124
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,110
The one who used the cap as an ear cleaner and bled.

125
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,110
Yeah, I figured if we were going to get complaints anyway,

126
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,110
I figured it might get used more if the pen

127
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:25,120
-already came with an ear cleaner.
-It's a case of misfortune turning into a blessing.

128
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,120
What can be better than changing

129
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,120
negative to positive.
Right?

130
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,120
-Thank you.
-You did a good job of naming it too.

131
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,130
The pen for those obsessed with writing,
Ka-ke Run Run.

132
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:42,130
The ear too, Ka-ke Run Run.

133
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:46,140
Ka-ke Run Run, Ka-ke Run Run,
Ka-ke Run Run, I'm Mamo-Run Run.

134
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,140
Oh, Makimura-san.

135
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,140
Hello.
You look like you're in a good mood.

136
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,150
Oh, sorry.
Oh, it looks like my proposal might go through.

137
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,150
That's great.

138
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,170
Good luck.
I'll be rooting for you.

139
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,170
-Thank you.
-See you then.

140
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,090
-Makimura-san.
-Yes.

141
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:14,090
Um..Do you have some time this week?

142
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,100
Yes.

143
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,110
-Nice.
-Nice.

144
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,110
-I wonder if there's snack at home.
-Knowing Marumo,

145
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,110
probably not?
But if there was

146
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,110
-I want ice cream.
-Me too.

147
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:34,120
Ice cream sure would be nice.
Premium one.

148
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,120
Kaoru-chan, bye bye.

149
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,120
-Bye bye.
-Bye bye.

150
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:59,140
Onee-chan, shall we go to the park after we're done with homework?

151
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,110
Then let's go to the park we went the other day.

152
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,980
Yeah, let's go there.

153
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,980
Let's hurry up and finish our homework.

154
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,980
Oh look. Pretty flowers.

155
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,990
Tomoki!

156
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
-Be careful.
-Tomoki, are you alright?

157
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Are you alright?
Are you alright? Did you get hurt anywhere?

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,010
I'm alright.

159
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,010
Are you alright?
You're bleeding.

160
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,010
It doesn't hurt, Tomoki?

161
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,010
Does it hurt?

162
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,020
-There, you're fine now.
-Thank you, Oba-chan.

163
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:47,020
-It's Onee-san, isn't it?
-Oh, Onee-san, thank you.

164
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,030
That's okay, you can call me Oba-chan.

165
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,030
Thank you very much.
Tomoki, let's go home.

166
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:55,030
Oh, that's right. Say...

167
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:58,030
would you eat this?

168
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,040
These cookies are delicious.

169
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,070
Wah~ I love cookies.

170
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:07,080
But we're not supposed to take anything from strangers.

171
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,080
That's right.

172
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,080
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

173
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,080
That's okay.

174
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,080
You're both very good kids.

175
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,100
Oba-san, have we met before?

176
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,100
What?

177
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,120
Kaoru-chan, Tomo-kun.

178
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,120
Aya-chan.

179
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,130
-Let's go home together.
-Okay.

180
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,130
-Oba-chan, bye bye.
-Bye bye.

181
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,130
Bye bye.

182
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,150
Okay, let's go.

183
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:27,150
About the kids' mother...

184
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,160
Do you think she contacted you

185
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,160
so that she could take the kids back or something?

186
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,170
I don't think so.

187
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,170
She's the one who left, leaving the kids behind.

188
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:45,180
Until then, Ayumi-san was working hard and doing really well.

189
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,180
But one day, something snapped inside her.

190
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:54,180
In the end, she was diagnosed with parenting neurosis,
and they had to get a divorce.

191
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:01,170
So what, she wants to see the kids now.

192
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,130
Even if she says she wants custody,

193
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,130
I'll never allow it.

194
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,140
A woman in her mid-30's?

195
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:20,140
Yes, at the park.
She was gazing intently at the kids.

196
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,150
Ayumi-san.

197
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,150
She might be the kids' mother.

198
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,150
Mother?

199
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,150
What? Really?

200
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,150
Probably.

201
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:34,160
I wonder if the kids realized that she's their mother.

202
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,160
No, they didn't look like they knew.

203
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,160
They were 3 when she left.
I don't think they even remember her what she looked like.

204
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,170
Besides, they think their mother died.

205
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,170
With the way things are now, I'm sure they'll be bewildered

206
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,170
if she comes forth saying she's their mother.

207
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:56,180
If they found out that their mother's alive,

208
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:59,180
if they found out that she left them behind,

209
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,180
how would they feel.

210
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,130
Gochisousa-mongoose.
(gouchisousama)

211
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:12,130
Oishikat-tanuki. (oishikatta - it was good + tanuki - badger)

212
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,130
Goshisousa-Marumo.

213
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:18,130
Gochisousa-mammoth.

214
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:23,140
Hey, do you guys remember your mom?

215
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,140
Mommy? Why?

216
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,140
Just wondering.

217
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,150
I don't remember her too well.

218
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,150
-Me neither.
-I see.

219
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:36,150
Because she died when we were only 3 years old.

220
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,150
You're right. You wouldn't remember, would you?

221
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,160
You're being strange, Marumo.

222
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,160
Never mind.
But tell me,

223
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,160
what do you want for your birthday present?

224
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,170
Hmm.  We already asked Santa so

225
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,170
you don't have to get us anything.

226
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,170
We'll wait until Christmas, so don't worry.

227
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:57,170
You make tako-san wiener for us.

228
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,170
-Kani-san wiener too.
-Wiener?

229
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,110
Santa, Santa.

230
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:08,120
If only I could find the letter to Santa.

231
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,120
What about the treasure box?

232
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,120
Treasure box?

233
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,120
You mean this?

234
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:23,130
What's this. Trash? It's not here.

235
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:26,140
This one maybe.

236
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:31,140
Price tags?

237
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:35,140
Why are these treasures.
I don't understand.

238
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,150
-Maybe here, huh?
-Yeah.

239
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,160
Give me a break.

240
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,110
"To Santa"

241
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,110
Bingo. Good job, Mook.

242
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,120
What's this.

243
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,120
"I want kasha-kasha.
Kaoru"

244
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,130
"I want puchi-puchi.
Tomoki"

245
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:27,130
Kasha-kasha? Puchi-puchi.

246
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:31,130
I don't get it.
In fact, I'm even more lost now.

247
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,140
How pathetic. You're their guardian, aren't you?

248
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,140
If I don't get it, I don't get it.

249
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,140
You. You're home all the time so

250
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,140
at least find a hint or something.
Enough of that already.

251
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,150
What are kasha-kasha and puchi-puchi?

252
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,150
Kasha-kasha, puchi-puchi.

253
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:49,150
Kasha-kasha, puchi-puchi.
Kasha-kasha, puchi-puchi.

254
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:52,160
Kasha-kasha, puchi-puchi. What are they~.

255
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,120
Kasha-kasha, puchi-puchi.
Kasha-kasha, puchi-puchi...

256
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,120
Hey, hey.

257
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,120
Is something wrong?

258
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,120
You were mumbling some weird spell or something right now, weren't you?

259
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,130
Oh, yes.

260
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:43,130
Actually, it's a secret code to the kids'

261
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,130
-birthday present.
-Secret code?

262
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,130
-Yes.
-Try saying it.

263
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:49,140
You won't know it anyway.
It's too hard.

264
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,140
Leave the reasoning to me.

265
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,140
I'm a Furuhata mania, you know.

266
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,140
I became a police officer wanting to be like "Furuhata Ninzaburou."

267
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:00,150
Okay, then what's kasha kasha?

268
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:03,150
Kasha-kasha?

269
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:06,150
I'm sorry~ I figured it out.

270
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,150
You sound just like him. Or rather, you already figured it out?

271
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,160
This is an anagram.

272
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,160
-Anagram?
-The letters were rearranged to

273
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,160
-form a different word.
-Ah.

274
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:23,170
Or it could be the first letter of a vertical reading of horizontal text.

275
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:28,190
Vertical reading of horizontal text. I didn't think of that.

276
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:31,110
Or, it could be a play on words.

277
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:34,110
You don't know, do you?

278
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,120
You don't have any idea, do you?

279
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,120
Forget it.

280
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,130
Onee-chan, aren't you looking forward to the birthday presents?

281
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,130
I wonder if Santa read our letter.

282
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,130
So what do you want?

283
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:55,130
Mook's a dog so it's okay if we tell him, huh?

284
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:59,140
Okay, we're only gonna tell you.

285
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,140
-Really?
-Yeah. I want puchi-puchi

286
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,140
and Onee-chan wants kasha-kasha.

287
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,150
So what is that?

288
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,150
Puchi-puchi.
Nice.

289
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:10,150
Kasha-kasha.

290
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,150
Puchi-puchi.
Nice.

291
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,150
Kasha-kasha.

292
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:18,160
Gochisousa-mantohihi*
(*baboon)

293
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,160
Oh, hey, hey, what do you guys

294
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,160
want for your birthday present?

295
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,160
-It's a secret.
-Secret.

296
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,130
What, you won't even tell me?

297
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,000
Because if we tell someone, Santa's

298
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,010
-not going to grant our wish.
-That's right.

299
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:36,010
Oh, I got it. A game for Tomoki-kun and clothes for Kaoru-chan.

300
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:39,010
-Bu~. Sorry.
-Sorry.

301
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:43,020
I don't know then.
Maybe what they want is a mommy.

302
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,020
What?

303
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,020
You dummy.

304
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,020
Oh, no, no, no, no.

305
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,020
What I meant was those sneakers that make you run faster. Right?

306
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,030
Yeah, that's it.
They're the in thing right now.

307
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,030
Oh, um...Those ones

308
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,030
they say that if everyone wore them
everyone would run faster to

309
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:00,030
in the end, everyone would still be in the same order. Right?

310
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:03,030
-They're popular but that's not it.
-That's not it, huh?

311
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,050
-Um...
-Yes.

312
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:19,050
You said you didn't have a boyfriend, right?

313
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,050
Yes.

314
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:27,060
Um...I...

315
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,100
I..

316
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,100
I...

317
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,100
I like this sumiso*.
(*vinegared miso)

318
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:37,100
Oh, yes.

319
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,110
I like...

320
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,110
-The sumiso.
-Yes.

321
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:44,110
No, that's not it.

322
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:48,110
Um...If you don't mind,

323
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:51,120
will you go out with me?

324
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,120
Just kidding...You wouldn't, would you?

325
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,130
That's okay.
Don't worry about it.

326
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,130
I just got excited on my own, that's all.

327
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,130
No.

328
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:09,140
Besides, actually I...

329
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,140
-I'd like that.
-Yes.

330
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,140
What? Really? Are you sure?

331
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,140
Yes. If you're okay with it.

332
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:22,150
What do you mean okay...

333
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:25,150
Are you serious?

334
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:36,100
Okay, then, well...um...but
actually, I'm komochi*... (*have children)

335
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,100
Komochi.
Well...

336
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,100
Shishamo.
Excuse me?

337
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,100
I think I saw it on the menu.

338
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,110
Excuse me. Komochi shishamo*, please.
(*smelt-like fish with roe, ie, children)

339
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,110
-Oh, and sake too.
-Komochi shishamo.

340
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,110
One komochi shishamo.

341
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,120
I'm home.

342
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,120
Oh, I guess they'd be asleep.

343
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,120
Mook-san, Mook-san.  Hello.

344
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:12,130
Kana-san said she'd go out with me.

345
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,130
Kana-san.  Kana-san.

346
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:26,150
But I missed the timing to tell her about the kids.

347
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:31,080
I'll tell her next time. Next time for sure.
I'll definitely tell you next time, Kana-san.

348
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,090
Marumo, it's crooked.

349
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:39,090
Is it?
Tomoki, hurry up and get ready.

350
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:42,090
Okay, just a minute.

351
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:45,100
-What about Strategy No. 2?
-Oh, that's right.

352
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:49,100
You know, Kaoru, I thought of a quiz. You wanna try?

353
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:54,110
Okay. What sound is zawa-zawa?

354
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:58,110
-The sound of wind?
-Correct.  Then what about kachi-kachi?

355
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:01,110
-Clock.
-Correct. Okay, here we go.

356
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,120
-What about kasha-kasha?
-Poop.

357
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,120
Correct. Poop. What? Poop?

358
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,120
-It's coming out.
-No wait. You have to hold it.

359
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,120
Bathroom, bathroom, bathroom, bathroom.
Go to the bathroom.

360
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,120
Don't let it out.
Go, go, go, go.

361
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,130
We're gonna be late.
Thanks, Marumo.

362
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,130
No, no, that's okay.

363
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:18,130
That's okay, but
Kaoru, what's the answer to kasha-kasha?

364
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,130
Huh, what's the answer to kasha-kasha?

365
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,130
Toilet paper!

366
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:25,140
Correct. Huh?

367
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,140
Toilet paper?
Toilet paper.

368
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,080
Wait a minute. Wait.
Where was it?

369
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,080
Mission failed again.

370
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,080
It's not on here.

371
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,080
What the heck is kasha-kasha and puchi-puchi.

372
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,090
Huh? Oh.

373
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:45,090
I'll buy it. Yes, I'm buying it.

374
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:48,090
What the heck is kasha-kasha.

375
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:51,100
This? This isn't it.

376
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,100
This? I don't think so.

377
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:01,110
Excuse me, Miss.
Are you about 6 years old?

378
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,110
Would you happen to know what kasha-kasha is?

379
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:07,110
-You don't know?
-Then what about puchi-puchi? Puchi-puchi.

380
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,120
Is it a candy?
You know, the kind that

381
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,120
goes pop pop (puchi-puchi) in your mouth, and kinda surprises you?

382
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,120
-No, huh?
-What are you doing?

383
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,120
I'm not a shady character, really.
This...

384
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,130
Hello. Akebono Office Supplies, Customer Service.

385
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,150
This is Mashima.

386
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:34,070
Yes. Yes, Takagi?
One moment please.

387
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:37,080
Takagi-san,
you have a call from an Aoki-san.

388
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,080
-Aoki?
-Yes.

389
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,080
Hello, this is Takagi.

390
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:49,080
Hello, it's been a while.
This is Aoki Ayumi.

391
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,120
I never thought that

392
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,120
Takagi-san would be taking care of the children.

393
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:05,130
Yes, well, it just turned out that way.

394
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:08,130
I'm sorry.

395
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:11,130
Shall we sit?

396
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,130
Yes.

397
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,140
You saw the kids, didn't you?

398
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:28,150
I know I have no right to face them, but

399
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:34,160
when I heard Junichirou passed away, I couldn't help worrying how they were doing.

400
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,160
If you're only worried, won't you just leave them alone?

401
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:43,160
It's not that you want to take them back or anything, right?

402
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:51,170
They've been told their mother died.

403
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:54,110
They already accepted the fact

404
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:57,110
that their mother is no longer in this world.  So...

405
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:00,120
Then I won't tell them that I'm their mother.

406
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,120
All I'm asking is to be near them and see their faces once in a while.

407
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,120
And I'm asking you not to see them with

408
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,120
that kind of half-baked feeling.

409
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:13,130
I know I'm the one

410
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,130
who don't have any right to be saying this.

411
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:21,130
I'm neither a relative nor related by blood.

412
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:30,150
But I know

413
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:38,150
how Sasakura felt as he was raising

414
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:40,150
those children.

415
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:48,160
I'm sorry for what I did.

416
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:53,190
Don't apologize to me.

417
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:58,110
If you're going to apologize, apologize to Sasakura.

418
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:04,110
I know I can't be forgiven no matter how much I apologize.

419
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,120
Back when I was raising those kids,

420
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:21,120
the harder I tried, the more I felt like I was spinning my wheels, and I lost sight of myself.

421
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:27,140
If I stayed with them

422
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:32,140
I got scared that I might ruin the children too

423
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:37,140
and I ran away.

424
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:45,150
They were always on my mind

425
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:49,150
even after I left them.

426
00:25:52,160 --> 00:26:00,100
There wasn't a day in the past 4 years that I didn't regret.

427
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,120
-We're almost there, huh?
-Yeah.

428
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,120
-Isn't it cute?
-Yeah, it's cute.

429
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,120
Thanks.

430
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,130
-Marumo, look at yours.
-Huh?

431
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:27,130
Oh, no.

432
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:29,130
What are you doing, Marumo.

433
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,130
Sorry, sorry.

434
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:34,140
Oh, by the way, isn't it about time you gave me a hint?

435
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,140
-Hint?
-You know, about the kasha-kasha and puchi-puchi.

436
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,140
-Why do you know about that, Marumo?
-Oh, um...well...

437
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,140
You know, that's because...

438
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,150
Oh, Santa called to make an inquiry.

439
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:48,150
What, he called here?

440
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

441
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,170
He said, "I read the letter."

442
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:58,090
"What color kasha-kasha do you want?"

443
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:02,100
-I want all different colors.
-Oh, so they're colorful.

444
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,100
-Yeah.
-Oh, and he also asked

445
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,100
"Where do they sell those?"

446
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:11,110
-Is Santa trying to buy them?
-But they don't sell those.

447
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:14,110
What? They're not sold?

448
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:18,110
What about my puchi-puchi?
What did Santa say?

449
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:20,120
Oh, um...

450
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:24,120
He asked "What flavor puchi-puchi do you like?"

451
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,120
-What, are they good?
-What, it's not something you eat?

452
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,130
I never ate it.
I'll try eating it next time.

453
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:35,130
What? What is it?

454
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:43,140
What could kasha-kasha and puchi-puchi be?
Tomorrow's their birthday already.

455
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:47,140
What, are you still racking your brain?

456
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,140
I don't know why you're so obsessed.

457
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:53,120
It's the thought that counts, so couldn't it be anything?

458
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,980
That's right.

459
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,990
I think the kids will be happy with any present

460
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:00,990
if it's from you.

461
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:04,990
I'm sure Sasakura

462
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:09,990
would have known what the kids wanted.

463
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
If Sasakura was alive, he wouldn't need a letter to know what they wanted.

464
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:30,020
It's because I'm not their real parent after all.

465
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:33,020
Takagi-san.

466
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:36,020
It's alright.

467
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:40,030
Don't worry.
Even if you're not their real parent.

468
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:43,030
-What?
-Even real parents,

469
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:47,040
no matter how well they think they know their children,

470
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,040
find out they don't know them at all sometimes.

471
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,080
Anyway, how much you're thinking about

472
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,080
those kids is more important than

473
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:01,080
whether you're bound by blood or not.

474
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:27,100
So Sasakura was trying to keep these away from them.

475

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,130
"Kaoru-chan and Tomoki-kun

477
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:54,060
played with blocks and behaved very well."

478
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,060
"From Yuuko Sensei."

479
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:12,080
"Today they told me how they played with Mommy."

480
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:17,090
"They looked happy as told me how they played store with the kasha-kasha

481
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:24,090
and puchi-puchi that came with the strawberries someone gave them."

482
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:31,090
Strawberries?
Store?

483
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,100
Okay, done.

484
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,100
This should do it.

485
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,100
-Are you done there?
-Just a little bit more.

486
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,110
-How is it?
-It's done, it's done.

487
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:49,110
Okay, gather 'round.

488
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:52,110
I'm going out for a bit so

489
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,110
can you guys wait downstairs?

490
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,110
-Where are you going?
-Just some place.

491
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:58,120
We'll have the birthday party when I get back.

492
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,120
We're going to have a feast.

493
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,120
-Yay!
-Hey, I asked for beef too.

494
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,120
-Super special beef.
-No way. Awesome.

495
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,130
What kind of beef do you think it is?

496
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:11,130
-Matsuzaka?
-Matsuzaka. Nope.

497
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:14,130
-Ichiro.
-Yes, the major leaguer, the pride of Japan...

498
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:17,140
No!
Wrong. You can't eat Ichiro.

499
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,140
-I told you, it's beef.
-But I don't know.

500
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,140
Okay, okay.
Save the surprise for later then.

501
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,140
You guys be good until then, okay?

502
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,140
Okay.
See you later.

503
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,140
See you later.

504
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,090
There should be a hint at the grocer.

505
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,100
-Welcome. What can I get for you?
-Welcome, What can I get for you?

506
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,100
I'd like some mangoes.

507
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,100
-Buy some strawberries.
-They're very sweet.

508
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,110
-They're very sweet.
-Let me have two then.

509
00:32:54,110 --> 00:33:00,110
Two mangoes.
Thank you. That will be 800 yen.

510
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,120
Excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me. Excuse me.

511
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,120
Excuse me, I have a favor to ask.

512
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,120
Yes?

513
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:20,130
-Excuse me, I have a favor to ask.
-Huh?

514
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:23,130
-Excuse me, I have a favor to ask.
-Yes?

515
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:28,140
Takagi-san's late.
Where did he go?

516
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,140
I wanna have the birthday party soon.

517
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,150
-Here you go.
-Okay.

518
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,080
It's ready.

519
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:41,090
Wow, look at the beef.

520
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:43,090
There's tako-san wiener too.

521
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:45,090
Looks good, huh?

522
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:47,090
Sorry.
-Oh, I'm sorry.。

523
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:49,090
-I'm late.
-Oh, you're home.

524
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:51,100
You're late, Marumo.

525
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,100
-Sorry, sorry.
-Look at the awesome beef.

526
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,100
-Awesome, huh?
-It's awesome.

527
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,110
-Beef festival. Ah, nice.
-Beef festival, ah, nice.

528
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,140
1, 2

529
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:38,080
Alright, happy birthday.

530
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,080
Thank you.

531
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:45,080
Okay, next is the long awaited present.

532
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,090
What is it, what is it, what is it?

533
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:49,090
Now, now, now, now.

534
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:09,100
-Hurry up and show us, Marumo.
-Hurry up.

535
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:21,120
Open. Meet your presents.

536
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:34,150
What, they're not it?

537
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:38,070
Did I get the wrong kasha-kasha and puchi-puchi?

538
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,070
Thank you, Marumo.

539
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:42,070
Marumo, you're amazing.

540
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:46,080
Yay, so many kasha-kasha.

541
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,080
They were given to me so they don't match or anything.

542
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:52,080
Puchi-puchi's awesome too. It's huge.

543
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,090
You can pop it all you want.

544
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:56,090
Yay!

545
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:59,090
-Marumo.
-Thank you.

546
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,090
Marumo, thank you.
For the kasha kasha.

547
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:03,090
We got them even before Santa.

548
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:05,100
-Yay.
-Yay.

549
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,100
I'm really glad.

550
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,100
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

551
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,100
Thanks.

552
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,110
-Thanks.
-I'm happy too.

553
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,110
Welcome.

554
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:25,120
Good evening.
My name is Aoki.

555
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,120
Is Takagi-san in?

556
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,120
Marumo, come here.

557
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,120
Welcome, welcome.
Hello.

558
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,130
Which one should I buy.
I'll take this one.

559
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:45,130
Thank you.

560
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:50,140
-That will be 2,000 yen.
-That's an expensive goma shio.

561
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,140
One moment please.

562
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:58,140
Marumo, come here.

563
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,150
Okay, one more time, Tomoki.

564
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:08,150
-Isn't this fun, Tomoki?
-Yeah, lots of fun.

565
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,160
Thank you for waiting.

566
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,160
Sorry for making you wait.

567
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,160
Hello.

568
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,160
-Takagi-san, do you have a minute?

569
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:33,110
Ayumi-san.

570
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:02,140
I'm sorry about the other day.

571
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,140
For saying I just wanted to be

572
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:09,150
close to the children and see them once in a while.

573
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:14,150
I reconsidered after realizing that

574
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,150
that's something that can't be allowed.

575
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:21,150
No, me too. I think I said some unnecessary things.

576
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:29,180
I'm going to try

577
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:32,180
to not see the children again.

578
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:43,110
But can you grant me just this one wish?

579
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:46,120
Today is

580
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,120
the children's birthday.

581
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,120
Yes.

582
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:59,120
If you don't mind, can you give them this?

583
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:04,140
This is...?

584
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:09,140
It's rather embarrassing, but it's a cake I made.

585
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:14,150
Actually, I wanted to buy something for their present,

586
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:19,150
but I have no idea what they'd want now.

587
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:26,150
They must have changed after 4 years too.

588
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,160
But still, I wanted to celebrate their birthday.

589
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:45,110
I understand. I'll make sure they get this.

590
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:47,110
Thank you.

591
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,120
Mamoru-san.

592
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:05,130
Please take care of the children.

593
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:33,090
84 yen, please.

594
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:37,100
Yes.
You're good at this, Kaoru-chan.

595
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:41,100
Puchi-puchi skate.
Puchi-puchi skate.

596
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,100
Puchi-puchi kick.

597
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,100
Is everything alright?

598
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,110
Ah...yes.

599
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:55,110
Kaoru, Tomoki. This is a present for you from my friend.

600
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,120
A cake. Open it.

601
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:11,130
It looks good.

602
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,140
It's "Guri and Gura."

603
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,140
That's right. It's "Guri and Gura."

604
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,140
Huh? What's that?

605
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,140
It's a picture book, right?

606
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:28,140
Yeah. Just a minute.

607
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:37,090
It's yummy.

608
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:39,090
Do you want to eat it too, Mook?

609
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,100
It's this.

610
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:54,110
See, it's on this page.

611
00:41:54,110 --> 00:42:00,110
I loved this picture book.
This castella* too. (*sponge cake)

612
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:02,110
Guri and Gura are twins.

613
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,120
Our names are Guri and Gura.

614
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:10,120
The things we like to do best are

615
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,120
cooking and eating.

616
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,130
Guri Gura Guri Gura.

617
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:21,130
We sing as we wait until the baking's done.

618
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:24,140
Making castella, Guri and Gura.

619
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:27,140
We're not stingy, Guri and Gura.

620
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:31,080
We'll give you a treat, so wait a while.

621
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,080
Looks like it's almost done.

622
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,080
"They looked happy when talked about

623
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:43,090
playing store with the kasha-kasha and puchi-puchi."

624
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:46,090
When Gura took the lid off the pan,

625
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:52,100
a yellow fluffy castella appeared.

626
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:56,100
[Actually, I wanted to buy something for their present,

627
00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:01,110
but I have no idea what they'd want now.]

628
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:06,110
[They must have changed after 4 years too.]

629
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:11,120
Wow, it looks yummy.

630
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:17,120
Everyone looked at it in amazement and were impressed.

631
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,130
You remember.

632
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:41,080
What? Hey...

633
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,080
-Marumo.
-Marumo.

634
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:54,090
[They were always on my mind.]

635
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:59,090
[There wasn't a day in the past 4 years that I didn't regret.]

636
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:16,110
Ayumi-san!
Ayumi-san!

637
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,120
Takagi-san.

638
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,130
They haven't changed at all.

639
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:38,060
Even after 4 years, those kids haven't changed at all.

640
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:47,080
They still love "Guri and Gura,"

641
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:54,090
they still love that castella,

642
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:58,090
they still love kasha-kasha and puchi-puchi.

643
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:13,100
See them once...before you go.

644
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:29,120
This is the Oba-chan who made the castella for you guys.

645
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:38,060
You were Marumo's friend?

646
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:40,060
Yes, that's right.

647
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:45,070
I see.
That's why you were kind to us.

648
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:48,070
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

649
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:52,080
The castella was really yummy.
Wasn't it, Onee-chan?

650
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:56,080
Yeah. We used to love that castella.

651
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,080
When Kaoru and Tomoki were way smaller,

652
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,080
we used to eat it.

653
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:03,080
Yeah. It's the castella from "Guri and Gura."

654
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:09,090
Oba-chan?

655
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:17,100
You be good and study hard, okay?

656
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,100
-Yes.
-Yes.

657
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:23,110
-You listen to Takagi-san, okay?
-Okay.

658
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:26,110
You know, Marumo's amazing.

659
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:31,120
He knows what we asked for from Santa.

660
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,120
He gave us lots of kasha-kasha and puchi-puchi that

661
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,120
-Kaoru and Tomoki wanted.
-That's great.

662
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,120
Woo~ Mambo

663
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:42,130
That's the magic spell he knows that makes flower grow.

664
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:45,130
And he plays catch with us.

665
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:48,130
And he bought us the ransels that Daddy promised to buy for us.

666
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:52,140
Marumo put the heart on mine too. Huh?

667
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,140
Yeah.
Mine is onigiri.

668
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:02,150
Oba-chan?

669
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:06,150
-Are you sad?
-No, I'm happy.

670
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:11,150
I have to get going.

671
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,160
Take care, both of you.

672
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:22,170
Okay. Will we see you again?

673
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:27,170
I'm going somewhere far away, so we probably won't meet again.

674
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:30,110
Oh, I see.

675
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:39,120
Take care, Kaoru-chan, Tomoki-kun.

676
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:43,120
Oba-chan too.

677
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:49,130
-Good bye.
-Good bye.

678
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:51,130
Good bye.

679
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:46,120
-Oba-chan, bye bye.
-Bye bye.

680
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,120
Bye bye.

681
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,160
Cheers.

682
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,100
Okay, let's eat the beef.

683
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:44,110
-Yum.
-Yum, what's this, it's yummy.

684
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:46,110
-What's this, it's yummy.
-Yum.

685
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:50,110
That's right, today's okite.

686
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,120
Here it comes, today's okite.

687
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:14,140
Birthdays have to be celebrated with the family.

688
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:16,140
Altogether now.

689
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:20,140
Birthdays have to be celebrated with the family.

690
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:23,150
Yes, if the whole family celebrates together,

691
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:25,150
the beef, the cake, everything will taste much better.

692
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:30,090
Then on Marumo's birthday, we'll celebrate with you.

693
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:34,090
Really? You will?

694
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:36,090
Mook's too.

695
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:38,100
Really?

696
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,100
When's your birthday?

697
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,100
Oh..when was it?

698
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:45,100
What, you'd better remember your own birthday.

699
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:54,110
Marumo.
The 8th, 9th, 10th...

700
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:57,110
You'll celebrate all our birthdays with us, won't you?

701
00:50:57,110 --> 00:50:59,120
-Yeah.
-That's a promise.

702
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,120
Yup, I promise.

703
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:05,120
I'll celebrate your birthday forever and ever.

704
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,120
Even if you tell me not to, I will.

705
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:12,130
Okay.
Let's eat. Itadakimasu.

706
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:16,130
-Itadakimasu.
-Itadakimasu.

707
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:18,130
Delicious.

708
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:27,140
This castella's really good.

709
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:30,080
It's yummy.

710
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:38,090
Marumo, do you cry when you eat something yummy?

711
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:41,090
Tears just come out when something's yummy.

712
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:46,100
-Marumo's crying.
-He's crying.

713
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:50,100
-Marumo's crying.
-He's crying a lot.

714
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:53,100
Don't say I'm crying.

715
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:56,110
He worked hard today,
so let him cry.

716
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:58,110
Be quiet.

717
00:51:58,110 --> 00:52:03,110
It's dripping, it's dripping.
It's dripping lots.

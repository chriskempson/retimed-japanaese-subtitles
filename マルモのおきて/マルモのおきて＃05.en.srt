1
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,190
Are you alright, Marumo?

2
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,190
Sorry.
I might have gave you my cold.

3
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,200
I'm alright.
You guys go to school.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,200
Yeah, but...

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,200
I'll watch him so don't worry.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,200
Okay, we'll leave him to Mook then.

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,210
-What? To the dog?
-See you later.

8
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,210
-We're going.
-Hey, you guys, hey.

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,220
What you nodding for.

10
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,220
-Morning.
-Morning.

11
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,220
Marumo

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,220
-caught a cold and can't get up.
-What?

13
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,230
So please take care of Marumo for us.

14
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,230
Okay, got it.
Go carefully, now.

15
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,230
-See you later.
-See you later.

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,180
I'm coming in.

17
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,180
Hey, I heard you weren't feeling well.
Shall I make you some porridge?

18
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,190
Thanks, but I have to go to work.

19
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,190
Are you alright?

20
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:16,190
Aren't your cheeks swollen?

21
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,190
What? Huh?

22
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,200
-It's just your imagination.
-No, I tell you, they're swollen,

23
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,200
It wouldn't be mumps, would it?

24
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,200
-What?
-I guess it wouldn't be.

25
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,210
Normally, you would've had it when you were a kid, right?

26
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,210
Right. Don't scare me like that.

27
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,210
Don't overexert yourself.

28
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,210
Okay, I'm leaving then.

29
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,220
Call me if you need anything.

30
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,220
Thanks.

31
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,220
I have to go for counseling today too.

32
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,170
-Hello, this is Takagi.
-Hey, Mom? It's Mamoru.

33
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,180
What happened? How have you been?

34
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,180
I've already had mumps, haven't I?

35
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,180
Once you've had it, you can't get it anymore, right?

36
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,180
Gosh, I think you've had it.

37
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,190
Or was that chicken pox?
Maybe it was measles.

38
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,190
Don't mothers usually remember stuff like that?

39
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,190
It's been so long, I forgot.

40
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:29,200
It's not a wah hah hah matter. Try to remember.

41
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,200
If a stranger starts talking to you,

42
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,200
don't trust him and go with him.

43
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,210
If you feel you're in danger, scream and run away.

44
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:40,210
You got that?

45
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:43,210
You all have the personal alarm I passed out, right?

46
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,220
I have mine on my ransel.

47
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,220
-Me too.
-Me too.

48
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,220
I'm hanging mine from my neck. Look.

49
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,160
-What are you doing?
-I'm sorry.

50
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,170
As you heard, it makes a loud noise,

51
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,170
so remember to be careful.

52
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,170
Yes.

53
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,170
Doctor, recently

54
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,180
he even says things like "I like this dog food better."

55
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,180
-The dog?
-The dog.

56
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,180
We all have conversations with the dog, and

57
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,180
sometimes I find myself talking to him.

58
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,190
Is this really the voice of my subconscious self?

59
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,190
-I've never heard of a case like this.
-What? Doctor, what?

60
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,190
Oh, nothing.
Let's see how it goes for a while.

61
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,200
Just take it easy.

62
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,200
By the way, Takagi-san, could that swelling

63
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,210
possibly be epidemic parotitis?

64
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:47,210
-In other words, mumps.
-Mumps?

65
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,210
-Mumps?
-That mumps?

66
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,210
-That mumps.
-Is he a kid?

67
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,220
I'm guessing he won't be back to work for at least a week.

68
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,220
My son had it too, but it's very painful.

69
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,240
High fever lasts for several days and this area around here swells up a lot.

70
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,160
That's awful.

71
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,160
Takagi-kun lives alone, doesn't he?

72
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,160
Huh? Yes, he does.

73
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,170
Why don't someone go see how he's doing?

74
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,170
I-I-I'll go.
Please let me go.

75
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,170
Why are you so eager?

76
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,170
I'm not...

77
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:22,170
-Itadakimasu.
-Itadakimasu.

78
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,190
Tomoki-kun, do you dislike carrots?

79
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,190
-Yeah.
-You're not supposed to leave any food.

80
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,190
You have to eat carrots too.

81
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,200
-That's right, that's right.
-Wh-wh-

82
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,200
what's going on?
You have to eat everything, you know.

83
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,200
The school says you don't have to eat everything because

84
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,210
of complaints from the parents, but I don't agree.

85
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,210
If you have likes and dislikes, you won't be strong and healthy.

86
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,210
Okay.

87
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,170
Tomoki.

88
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,170
Onee-chan.

89
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,170
I guess I have no choice.

90
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:39,190
Thanks. Why aren't we alike even though we're twins?

91
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,190
It's strange, huh?

92
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,190
Be careful. Straight ahead. Keep it straight.

93
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,200
-Like this?
-But just think.

94
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,200
He really did have mumps.

95
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,200
He must not have had it when he was a child.

96
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,200
Seriously, what an oddball he is, that guy.

97
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,140
Takagi-san, you sleep in this room for a while, okay?

98
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,150
It won't be good if you give it to the kids.

99
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,150
Yes, thanks.

100
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,160
We're home.

101
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,160
-Hi.
-What happened?

102
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,160
You guys stay in this room

103
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,160
-for a few days, okay?
-Why?

104
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,170
Takagi-san's sleeping in the other room. He has mumps.

105
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:29,170
His cheeks are swollen and he has a high fever.

106
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,170
You won't want to catch it, so make sure you don't go in that room.

107
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,180
-Okay.
-Don't come in here.

108
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,180
Are you alright, Marumo?

109
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,180
Yeah, I'm fine.

110
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,180
Marumo.

111
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,180
We'll come up frequently to see how things are going,

112
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,190
so don't worry. Okay?

113
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:49,190
Okay.

114
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,200
I wonder if Marumo's alright.

115
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,140
-I'm gonna take a peak.
-No, you can't.

116
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,140
If you open the door, Marumo's going to turn into a crane.

117
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:09,140
Crane?! Okay, I won't.

118
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,140
-Let's finish our homework.
-Okay.

119
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,160
Who could it be?

120
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,160
Shall we go see?

121
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,160
Mamoru? Are you there, Mamoru?

122
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,170
Who is this?

123
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,180
Who are you?

124
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,180
-Who are you?
-Who are you guys?

125
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,190
You too, Oba-chan, who are you?
-But, isn't this

126
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,190
-Takagi Mamoru's house?
-It is.

127
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:59,190
-What do you mean it is?
-Mom?

128
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,190
-Sasakura-kun's children?
-Yeah.

129
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,190
But why you?

130
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,190
It's not that they don't have relatives, right?

131
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,200
Oh, I remember he had a brother.

132
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,200
He did, but the kids were about to be

133
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,200
separated if they went with their relatives.

134
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,210
Still, don't you think you're being irresponsible taking them in?

135
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:58,210
It's hard enough to raise your own children,

136
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,210
let alone other people's children.

137
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,210
And two of them at that.

138
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,220
It's just not possible.

139
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,220
You don't know that until I try it.

140
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,220
And if something happened,

141
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,220
how are you going to apologize to Sasakura-kun?

142
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:14,230
That's...
Seriously...

143
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,230
I heard you weren't feeling well, so I came to Tokyo,

144
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,230
but look at this.

145
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,230
I won't approve of this.

146
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,230
Take those children back immediately.

147
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,240
In the first place, while you're lying here sick,

148
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,240
who's taking care of those children?

149
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,240
Mom, why don't take it easy and stay here for 2 or 3 days?

150
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,180
What?

151
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,180
Why do I have to be doing this.

152
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:50,190
Are you hungry?

153
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:54,190
Oh, it's that time already.
We'll have to make dinner, won't we?

154
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,210
There's nothing decent in here.

155
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:05,210
What do you want to do about dinner?

156
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:11,220
-She's Marumo's mommy.
-Nice to meet you.

157
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,220
I'm the daughter of the landlord downstairs.
My name's Hatanaka Aya.

158
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,220
Thank you for putting up with Mamoru all the time.

159
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,220
She's going to make dinner for us.

160
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,230
Oh really, how nice.
You're okay then, huh?

161
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,230
I'm sorry.
They must impose on you a lot.

162
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:32,230
No, not at all. Good bye then.

163
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,180
-How were the kids doing?
-Looks like they're fine.

164
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,180
Takagi-san's mother was there.

165
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,180
Mother?

166
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,180
Has he told her the whole story

167
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:48,190
-about the kids?
-I'm not sure.

168
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,190
-She'd be surprised if she found out suddenly, huh?
-That's for sure.

169
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,190
Most mothers wouldn't approve.

170
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:56,190
Hello, welcome.

171
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,200
Good evening.

172
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Oh, you're from Takagi-san's office.

173
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
You remembered? I'm Mashima.

174
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,200
I'm so pleased you remember me.

175
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,210
I'm here to visit Takagi-san.

176
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:11,210
This is a nice restaurant.
Are you always here...

177
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,210
If you came to see Takagi Mamoru, his room's on the 2nd floor.

178
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,210
Ah, yes.

179
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:19,220
So her name's Aya-san.
She's pretty, isn't she?

180
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,220
I wonder if she has a boyfriend.

181
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,220
She wouldn't happen to be after you, would she?

182
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,220
No she wouldn't.

183
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,220
Or rather, why are you here?

184
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,230
To see how you're doing, of course.

185
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,230
But it's good that your mother's here.

186
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,200
I guess, although her nagging's killing me.

187
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,070
A little while ago too, she was nagging about the kids.

188
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:41,070
She told me to return them to their relatives.

189
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,070
Well, I can see how they would be tough to manage by yourself.

190
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,080
It would be easier if you had a wife or girlfriend, but

191
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,080
you have nothing of that sort, do you?

192
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,080
Sorry for not having any.

193
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,080
And your face is all swollen.

194
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,090
You'd better not tell Makimura-san about this.

195
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:59,090
I wouldn't know what to do if she came anyway.
I can't show her my face,

196
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,090
and what would happen if she found out about the kids.

197
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,090
I won't tell her, but I seriously doubt

198
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:06,100
-if Makimura-san would visit you.
-Fantasy like that's necessary too

199
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,100
at times like this in my weakened condition.

200
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,110
Here you go, eat up.

201
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,110
-Itadakima~su.
-Itadakimasu.

202
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:22,110
This is awesome. The fridge was almost empty, but you made all this.

203
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,120
-Delicious.
-Really? I'm glad.

204
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,120
-We usually have the goma shio boss.
-Goma shio boss?

205
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,120
This one.

206
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,130
-Thank you, Boss.
-Thanks.

207
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,170
But how terrible.
Is he only feeding you this kind of thing?

208
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:45,170
-It's good.
-Even if it's good...

209
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:51,180
Tomoki-kun, don't you like carrots?

210
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:55,180
-No.
-He got scolded at school during lunch too.

211
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,180
I don't have to eat it when I'm home, do I?

212
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:02,190
It's okay with me.

213
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,190
What a relief.

214
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:07,190
By the way, where's your chopsticks and rice bowls?

215
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:10,190
-This is all we have.
-Really? Seriously...

216
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,200
He's just not very thoughtful about these things.

217
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,200
It's hard to eat, isn't it?

218
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,200
Okay, let's go shopping tomorrow.

219
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,210
Okay. Yay!

220
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:27,210
Mamoru, I'm going shopping with the kids.

221
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:30,210
-Okay.
-Will Marumo be alright?

222
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,220
Will he be alright?

223
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,220
I brought him some porridge a little while ago, so he should be fine.

224
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,150
While you're there, buy Mook's food too.

225
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:42,150
Really. He doesn't make much money and he's even taking care of a dog.

226
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,170
Marumo gets mad when we eat his ice cream.

227
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:51,170
That's so immature of him.

228
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,170
Did he always like ice cream?

229
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:56,170
Yes. Like when he caught a cold,

230
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,180
he'd always say "I want ice cream" and made a big fuss.

231
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,180
Shall we buy some today?

232
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,180
Yes, let's do that.

233
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,180
Yay!

234
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,190
Tomoki, you said that because you want ice cream.

235
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,190
You got me.

236
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,190
Ice cream.

237
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,190
We want ice cream.

238
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,200
-Premium.
-What?

239
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,200
Ice cream.

240
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,210
Yay! They're so cute.

241
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,210
I'm going to have seconds with this.

242
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:37,150
Thank you, Marumo Mommy.
Thank you.

243
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:40,150
-Alright.
-What are you making for dinner?

244
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:43,150
Hamburger.
Go play until dinner.

245
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,160
Yay.
Hamburger.

246
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,160
Onee-chan, let's go to the park.

247
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,160
Okay.

248
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,160
-Are you two going to be okay by yourselves?
-It's close by.

249
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,170
-Are you sure?
-Marumo, we're going out to play.

250
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,170
Oh, take the personal alarm with you.

251
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,170
Okay.

252
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,170
If a suspicious person starts talking to you, pull on it.

253
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,170
-Okay.
-Okay.

254
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,180
What a terrible world this has become.
To have to teach them to be suspicious of people.

255
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,180
That's the way things are nowadays.

256
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,180
-We're going then.
-See you later.

257
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,180
Beware of strangers.

258
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,180
-Okay.
-Okay.

259
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,220
Let's go to that park we went the other day.

260
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,140
Okay.

261
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,140
Excuse me.

262
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,150
-Who is he?
-I don't know.

263
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,160
What's that?

264
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,160
It's going off.
Mamoru, it's going off.

265
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,160
I heard, I heard...
Why are you holding that?

266
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,160
What's going on?

267
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:07,170
How do you stop this?

268
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,180
Hello, everyone.

269
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,180
Chief.

270
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,180
I'm sorry.

271
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:31,190
I thought you had something going on, but

272
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:36,190
I never would have guessed you were taking care of your late friend's children.

273
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,190
I was surprised too.

274
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,190
I don't even have grandchildren yet.

275
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:43,200
Mom, go to the other room please.

276
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,200
Okay, okay.
Please make yourself at home.

277
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:00,210
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

278
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,220
And so?

279
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:06,220
What are your plans for the future?

280
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:11,230
I'd like to go on living with those kids.

281
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,230
I'm sorry.
That's why I'm not sure what I should do.

282
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:20,230
I don't want to be a burden to my colleagues.

283
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:24,170
Is it possible to get a transfer to a department

284
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:27,170
where I won't have to work overtime?

285
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:33,180
You're serious about living with those children, then?

286
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,180
Yes.

287
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,190
Is it okay if I sit comfortably?

288
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,190
Oh, sorry. Please do.

289
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:46,190
-I have sciatica.
-Oh, I forgot that you did. Sorry.

290
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,200
Then just stay with our department.

291
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,200
-Pardon me?
-Customer Service Department

292
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:57,200
stops taking calls at 5 PM.
After that, you just have to wrap things up.

293
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,210
If you can get everyone to cooperate,

294
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:02,210
I think you can manage to make it.

295
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:05,210
Chief.

296
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:08,220
Thank you.

297
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:13,220
But you sure choose to live the hard way, don't you?

298
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:16,220
You could have chosen an easier path.

299
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,160
-Hello.
-Hello.

300
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,170
Is Takagi-san here?

301
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:29,170
He's out sick with the mumps.

302
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,170
-Mumps?
-It's unusual, isn't it,

303
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,170
to get it at that age.
Did you need something?

304
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,180
Well, yes...

305
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,180
I wanted him to take a look at the report of the last business trip.

306
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,180
I think he'll be off for about a week.

307
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,180
-I see.
-Oh, Makimura-san.

308
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,190
There's absolutely no need for you to go visit him.

309
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,190
Takagi-san's face is all swollen like this.

310
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,190
Is it that bad?

311
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,190
It's bad, real bad.
He looks like something out of a horror movie.

312
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,190
-Horror?
-That's scary.

313
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:58,200
So it would be best you stayed away from him for a while.

314
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,200
It's good.

315
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,210
It's good. Marumo Mommy, you're awesome.

316
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,210
I'm so glad.

317
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,210
Poor Marumo.
He can't eat.

318
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:14,210
But I made a lot so

319
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,220
he can eat it when he gets better.

320
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,220
I guess so.

321
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:23,240
What kind of a kid was Marumo?

322
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,160
Tell us, tell us.

323
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:30,160
Well, let's see. He always liked baseball.

324
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,170
He'd be out in the field playing until dusk.

325
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,170
With Daddy?

326
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:38,170
Yes.  He was really close to Sasakura-kun.

327
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:43,180
They were always together, like brothers, doing foolish things.

328
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:47,180
Like breaking a neighbor's window while playing baseball, and

329
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:52,190
oh, that's right, they dug a huge pitfall in the schoolyard,

330
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:56,190
but then a teacher fell in it.

331
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:02,200
They were bad boys.

332
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,200
They were, weren't they.

333
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,200
They definitely weren't good boys.

334
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,200
I never saw either one of them working on

335
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,200
their homework.

336
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,210
But he always tells us to do our homework.

337
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,210
Marumo's not fair.

338
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,210
-Not fair.
-Not fair

339
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,210
Are they badmouthing me?

340
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:28,160
You ate all your hamburger.

341
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,160
Yes. It was good.

342
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,160
Tomoki-kun, it looks like you can eat carrots, huh?

343
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,160
-What?
-There were carrots

344
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:41,170
in the hamburger.
I chopped them real small and put them in there.

345
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:44,170
No, really?

346
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:47,170
I couldn't tell.

347
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:50,180
Mamoru didn't like carrots either when he was little.

348
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,180
But when I chopped it real fine and mixed it in, he couldn't tell and ate it.

349
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:56,180
So I can eat carrots.

350
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,190
Aren't you glad?

351
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:01,190
Sasakura-kun used to come to our house all the time

352
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,190
and ate this hamburger too.

353
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:10,200
Daddy used to like this hamburger too.

354
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,200
I want to see Daddy.

355
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,210
What?

356
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,210
I want to talk with Daddy.

357
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:28,150
Yes, but that's impossible because he's in heaven.

358
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:31,150
Heaven's far away, isn't it?

359
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,160
Yes, it is.

360
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:15,200
Mamoru, are you up?

361
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
Yeah.

362
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,140
You know.
What?

363
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,150
-It's about those children.
What?

364
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:37,150
You should have their relatives take care of them after all.

365
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:40,150
You can't take Sasakura-kun's place.

366
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,160
-But Mom...
-I'm not

367
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,160
talking about you.

368
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,160
I'm saying this for the children's sake.

369
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:55,170
As things are, all you can do is make them feel lonely.

370
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:58,170
-Mom.
-You can't raise children all by yourself.

371
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:06,180
Of course, it's a different story if you had someone who'd marry you.

372
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,190
But you don't have anyone like that, do you?

373
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:21,190
Anyway, talk it over with Sasakura-kun's brother again.

374
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:25,130
If you won't, I'll go talk to him.

375
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,130
Alright?

376
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:46,180
-Is Daddy sleeping here?
-Yes.

377
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:49,180
Then is this heaven?

378
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:52,180
No, this isn't heaven.

379
00:23:54,180 --> 00:24:00,190
But when you feel like talking to your daddy, you can come here and talk to him.

380
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,190
You voice will definitely reach your daddy in heaven.

381
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:06,200
Okay.

382
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,200
Okay, let's go.

383
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,200
This is it here.

384
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:26,220
Shall we clean up the grave so that your daddy

385
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,220
and rest peacefully in heaven?

386
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,170
Yes.

387
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:46,170
Excuse me.

388
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:48,170
How do you feel?

389
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:52,180
Here.
Dad told me to check up on you.

390
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:55,180
Thanks.
The fever's gone down.

391
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:58,180
That's good.

392
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,180
You must be relieved that

393
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,190
your mother's here.

394
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,190
She's taking good care of the kids.

395
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:07,190
Yes.

396
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:10,190
Is something wrong?

397
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:15,200
My mom's telling me to take the kids back to their relatives.

398
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,200
-What?
-She said

399
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,200
I won't be able to raise the kids by myself.

400
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:26,210
But Takagi-san, you're trying so hard to do everything you can.

401
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:31,210
But I couldn't say anything back to her.

402
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:35,220
When she said "Do you think a man can raise kids by himself?"

403
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:39,220
She told me "all you can do is make them feel lonely."

404
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:43,160
But if you didn't take care of them,

405
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,160
the kids would be separated.

406
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,170
Of course I want to

407
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:51,170
go on living with those kids too.

408
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:59,170
But I'm probably too flaky in my mom's eyes.

409
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:09,190
Thank you.

410
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:12,190
Okay, put your hands together like this.

411
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:17,190
Sasakura-kun.

412
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:19,190
Daddy.

413
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:29,210
Daddy, I've been meaning to tell you.

414
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:32,210
Marumo's letting us live with him.

415
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:35,210
A dog called Mook's with us too.

416
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:38,210
I was almost separated from Tomoki, but

417
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:40,210
Marumo told us we could be together.

418
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,150
And the ransel you promised us,

419
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:47,160
Marumo bought them for us.

420
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,160
Marumo even put a heart on mine.

421
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:55,170
And he plays catch with us too.

422
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:58,170
He's really bad at it, but he sewed name tags on our gym clothes.

423
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:03,170
He's a shorty, but he gave me a piggyback ride.

424
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:08,180
And he taught me magical spell to make the flower sprout.

425
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,180
Like this. Woo~ Mambo.

426
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,180
Then the flower really sprouted.

427
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:18,190
And he came to watch us at the entrance ceremony too.

428
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:24,190
Look at Marumo's funny face.

429
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,200
This is Mook.

430
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,210
Daddy.

431
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:45,210
Daddy's not here, but we have Marumo.

432
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:52,150
So don't worry about us, Daddy.

433
00:27:55,160 --> 00:28:01,160
We love Daddy, but we love Marumo too.

434
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,170
Yeah, we love Marumo.

435
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:59,150
Hey, Mook.
What should I do?

436
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,160
You have any good ideas?

437
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,160
You won't talk when I ask you to, huh?

438
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,160
Hey.

439
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,170
Hello, this is Takagi.

440
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:21,180
This is Makimura.
Thank you for helping me out the other day.

441
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:24,180
Makimura-san.
I'm sorry for

442
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,180
-taking off like that.
-No, please don't worry about it.

443
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:31,190
I was thinking of coming there to visit you now.

444
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:34,190
What? Really?

445
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:39,200
Um...um... but
No. Please don't mind me.

446
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,130
But you helped me out on that business trip too, so

447
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:44,130
I'll just stop by real quick and leave right away.

448
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,140
I'm already almost there.

449
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,140
What, you are?

450
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:52,140
What? But, but...
No, you can't come.

451
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,140
No, no, no.
You really can't.

452
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,150
But I heard you weren't doing well so

453
00:29:56,150 --> 00:30:01,150
-I got worried.
-What? Worried? She said she's worried.

454
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,150
Yes, you're right.
I feel awful.

455
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:06,160
So you shouldn't come, Makimura-san.
You might catch it too.

456
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,160
I already had mumps when I was little, so I'll be fine.

457
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:14,160
Is there anything you want to eat or want me to do for you?

458
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,170
I'm happy.

459
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:19,170
Very very happy.
I'm happy, but...

460
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:21,170
Tell me anything.

461
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:26,170
What should I do.
What can I do. Um...

462
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:34,180
Actually, I have a favor to ask.

463
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:42,130
[My mom's telling me to take the kids back to their relatives.]

464
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:48,130
Hey Aya.
Take this upstairs for them.

465
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:51,130
I got a nice fish, so we'll share it with them.

466
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:53,130
Okay.

467
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,140
What's wrong?

468
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:05,150
I guess Takagi-san's mother is opposed to his taking care of the kids.

469
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:08,150
She is, huh? Well,

470
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:11,150
it's tough for a man to raise kids by himself.

471
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:14,160
-Yeah.
-Things might work out if

472
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,160
he can find himself a nice girl,

473
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:20,160
-but that might be difficult too.
-Do you think so?

474
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,170
He didn't have a girlfriend up to now either, did he?

475
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:26,170
And now he's suddenly got two kids. Right?

476
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:28,170
Yeah.

477
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:35,170
I can understand why his mother would be worried too.

478
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:41,120
[Marumo's family, isn't he?]

479
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,120
[Even if we don't have Daddy or Mommy,
Marumo's family, isn't he?]

480
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,120
[How many times are you two going to practice?]

481
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,130
[As many times as we can. We're going to answer loudly

482
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:52,130
so that Marumo can hear us.]

483
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:56,130
[Tomoki, hang on.]

484
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:58,130
[I have a sick child.
Please open the door.]

485
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:00,140
[Please, please.]
[She told me

486
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,140
all I can do is make the kids feel lonely.]

487
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:06,140
[I want to go on living with those kids.]

488
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,160
Hello.

489
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,160
Oh, Aya-san.

490
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,170
If you don't mind, please eat it.

491
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:35,170
Thank you very much.

492
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:38,170
How's Takagi-san doing?

493
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:42,110
I think he's doing much better, thank you.

494
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,110
That's good.

495
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:47,120
Um...

496
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,120
Um..Mother.

497
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,120
Yes.

498
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,120
To tell you the truth, Takagi-san...

499
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:01,130
I mean, Mamoru-san and I are dating.

500
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:03,130
What?

501
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:06,140
What did you just say?

502
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:10,140
Um..What I mean is, Mamoru-san and I are dating, so

503
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,140
the two of us will take care of the children.

504
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,140
So please put your mind at ease.

505
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:21,150
Yes.

506
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:27,160
Mother.

507
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:34,160
Nice to meet you. I'm Mamoru-san's fiancee, Makimura Kana.

508
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,170
-Yes...What?
-Fiancee?

509
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:40,170
-What!
-No way!

510
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:42,170
What's going on? I can't hear.

511
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:58,210
Marumo's popular with the ladies?

512
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:00,220
He's a disgusting two-timer.

513
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:03,220
-Disgusting?
-Disgusting.

514
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:09,230
Um...Your name is Makimura-san, did you say?

515
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,230
Yes.
And you're

516
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:15,230
Mamoru's fiancee?

517
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:19,240
Yes. I work at Akebono Office Supplies

518
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,240
and I've been dating Mamoru-san.

519
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,240
I see.

520
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:32,250
What? Oh..I'm..Uh...

521
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:35,250
Oh, I must have misunderstood.

522
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:38,250
If Takagi-san's happy, that's all that matters.

523
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,250
I'm sorry.

524
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:45,190
Well, then..uh..

525
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:49,190
I have to go help out at the restaurant so I'll get going.

526
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:01,210
What? What happened?

527
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:04,210
I swear!

528
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:07,220
After I went through the trouble to put on an act for him.

529
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,220
-Hey, what's wrong?
-Nothing!

530
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:17,230
So you're here today to...?

531
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:20,230
I came see how Mamoru-san was doing,

532
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:22,230
and I also heard that you were visiting so

533
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,230
I thought I'd stop by to say hello.

534
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:28,240
Well, thank you very much.

535
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,240
I see.

536
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,240
So Mamoru had someone like you.

537
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,250
I'm really sorry.

538
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:43,250
For asking you to do something like this.

539
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:47,190
That's alright.
But was it okay?

540
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:51,190
Pretending to be your fiancee so that you'd have an excuse to decline the arranged marriage.

541
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,200
You saved me, really. My mom's

542
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,200
been on my case to go for an arranged marriage.

543
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,200
I'm glad then.

544
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,200
Oh, by the way, who are those children?

545
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:05,210
What? Huh?
Were there children out there?

546
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:07,210
-Yes.
-Hmm...who are they?

547
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:09,210
Oh, are they child spirits?

548
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:12,210
Huh? What?
No, that's not it.

549
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:16,220
Oh, my mom's kid...is me.

550
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,220
Her kid is me, so that's not it.

551
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:21,220
Um...they're relatives. Yes, they're our relative's kids

552
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,230
who are visiting my mom right now.

553
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,230
Oh, that's who they are.

554
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:28,230
But anyway, I'm glad

555
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:31,230
I was able to help you out.

556
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,240
Thank you so much.

557
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,240
Don't mention it.

558
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,240
I wonder if girls like Marumo.

559
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,240
Isn't it strange?
He's not good looking.

560
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,240
And he's short.

561
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,200
Yes.

562
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:15,210
Mom.
About those kids...

563
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:18,210
-Like I said before, I want to...
-I'm going home tomorrow.

564
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:21,220
-What?
-Make sure you take good care

565
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:24,220
of those children.

566
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,220
Are you really okay with that?

567
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,220
Thanks, Mom.

568
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:37,230
Makimura-san's a charming person, isn't she?

569
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,240
Yes she is.

570
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,240
But if I were to pick one, I think I like Aya-san better.

571
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,170
Aya-san?
Why's Aya-chan's name coming up now?

572
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:51,180
Ah~ I'll finally be free.

573
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,180
You were a big help.

574
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,190
Good evening.
-Wel...Oh, hello.

575
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:08,200
Do you have a minute?
Thank you for the fish.

576
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,200
Oh, it wasn't much.

577
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,200
Let me get you a cup of tea.
Have a seat.

578
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,210
Thank you.

579
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:19,210
Where's Aya-san?

580
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:22,210
She just left to go shopping.

581
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:24,210
Oh, I see.

582
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:28,220
I wanted to thank you for everything you did for Mamoru.

583
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:31,220
We really haven't done anything.

584
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:36,230
Mamoru's doing admirably.

585
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,230
But he's a headache for me, doing whatever he wants to do.

586
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:42,230
Yes.
They do whatever they want, don't they, the kids.

587
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:44,250
Really.

588
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:46,250
They won't listen to their parents at all.

589
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:52,170
But I've been thinking lately.

590
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:58,180
That maybe the only thing parents can do is to watch over them.

591
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,180
You may be right.

592
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:06,190
Maybe all we can do is trust our children and watch over them.

593
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,190
Yes.

594
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:12,190
Have some tea.

595
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:15,200
Looks good.

596
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,200
Itadakimasu.

597
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,210
-Watch your step.
-Thanks.

598
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:32,210
You two take care, okay?

599
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:35,220
Come and visit Marumo Mommy sometime too.

600
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:38,220
Okay.
Thank you.

601
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,220
Oh, are you leaving now?

602
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:44,190
Thank you for everything.

603
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:47,060
Please continue to watch over

604
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,060
these children.

605
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,070
Certainly.

606
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:54,070
Aya, why don't you go with her to the train station?

607
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:59,070
Thank you.
Mom, you take care of yourself.

608
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:01,080
Speak for yourself.

609
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:04,080
-Come see us again.
-It's a promise.

610
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,080
Yes, promise.

611
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,080
Take care.

612
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,080
-Here, I'll take that.
-Thank you.

613
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:18,090
-Bye bye.
-Bye bye.

614
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:21,090
-Bye bye!
-Bye bye!

615
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:34,110
Thank you, Aya-san.

616
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:37,110
For pretending that you were dating Mamoru

617
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:40,120
so that I wouldn't worry.

618
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,120
Oh, you knew?

619
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,160
There's no way Mamoru could be going out

620
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,160
with someone as lovely as you.

621
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:53,160
That's not true.
Besides, he has a fiancee.

622
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,160
Oh, that's a lie too.

623
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,170
I was opposed to him raising those kids by himself so

624
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:01,170
he probably patched things up for the moment.

625
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:06,180
Then you're leaving, knowing everything?

626
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,180
Yes.

627
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:11,180
Mamoru is a hopeless child,

628
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,180
but I realized that

629
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:17,190
those children need Mamoru.

630
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:21,190
Besides, including you and your father,

631
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:25,190
there are so many people who care about Mamoru.

632
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:31,200
So I decided to watch over him too.

633
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,200
I see.

634
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:40,210
Takagi-san is really trying hard.

635
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:45,150
They're not even his own kids, and to do that much...

636
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:50,150
I'm not sure I'd be able to do the same if I was in his position.

637
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:53,160
He's really amazing.

638
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:58,160
Aya-san, please help out Mamoru

639
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,160
and the children in the future too.

640
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,160
Yes.

641
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,180
Yum.

642
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,180
Marumo, do you have a girlfriend?

643
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:26,190
Nope.
That thing about a fiancee, that's a lie too.

644
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:28,190
-That's what I thought.
-That's what I thought.

645
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:30,190
-That's what I thought.
-Don't be saying that.

646
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:32,190
Seriously...

647
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:35,200
Mom's hamburger sure is yummy though.

648
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,200
Thanks to this hamburger,

649
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,200
Tomoki can eat carrots now.

650
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,200
Good for you.

651
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,220
Carrots have lots of vitamins.
You shouldn't be picky.

652
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,140
You couldn't eat carrots either.

653
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:51,150
Huh?
How did you know that?

654
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:55,150
Must be Mom.
Why'd she have say such useless things.

655
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:01,160
Okay, I'm gonna write down the okite for the day.

656
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,160
Okay.

657
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:19,170
Don't be picky. Don't leave food on your plate.

658
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:21,180
All together now.
Don't be

659
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,180
picky. Don't leave food on your plate.

660
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,180
By eating everything on your plate,

661
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:28,180
you're showing your appreciation to the person who made it, okay?

662
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,190
-Got it.
-Got it.

663
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:34,190
Okay.
But that mumps was sure a pain.

664
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:37,190
-You're all well now, aren't you?
-Yeah, once you get it,

665
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:39,190
you won't get it anymore.
Measles too.

666
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:42,200
Did you ever have measles, Marumo?

667
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,200
Of course, I...

668
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:48,200
Did I have it?
Measles?

669
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,210
-What!
-Oh no!

670
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,210
Measles too?

671
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:54,210
Did I have measles?

672
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:56,210
What does measles feel like?

673
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:58,210
Is this feeling measles?
Is this measles?

674
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:00,220
Measles now? I can't tell.

675
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,220
Call Marumo Mommy. Call her, call her.

676
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,220
I'll ask her.

677
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:11,230
Hurry up and answer the phone. Hurry, hurry.

678
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:13,230
Mom~!
